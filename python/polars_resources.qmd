Here are a couple of resources on Polars.

:::

### Polars website

- [Official documentation](https://docs.pola.rs/) \
- [Polars API](https://docs.pola.rs/py-polars/html/reference/) \
- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars)

### Book

[Kevin Heavey](https://github.com/kevinheavey) wrote [Modern Polars](https://kevinheavey.github.io/modern-polars/) following the model of the [Modern Pandas](http://tomaugspurger.net/posts/modern-8-scaling/) book. This is a great resource, although getting a little outdated for the scaling chapter since Polars is evolving so fast.
