When you launch Python, you can access many functions.

But Python also comes with a *standard library* of several modules. Each module contains additional functions that can be loaded in a session.

:::{.example}

Example: the `math` module.

:::

```{python}
print('pi is', pi)
```

```{python}
import math
print('pi is', math.pi)
```

You can create an alias from the library:

```{python}
import math as m
print(m.pi)
```

You can also import `math`'s items directly:

```{python}
from math import pi, sin
print(sin(pi/6))
```

```{.python}
help(math)   # Help for libraries works just like help for functions
```
