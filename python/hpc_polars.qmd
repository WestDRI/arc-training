[Polars](https://pola.rs/) is a modern open source and very fast DataFrame framework for Python, Rust, JS, R, and Ruby. In this course, we will cover Polars for Python.

Multi-threaded queries, [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) vectorization, automatic parallelization, columnar [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) memory format, and [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) make Polars much faster than [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Polars is superior to pandas in other ways as well such as proper support for missing data and an ability to work with more data than can fit in memory. The API is intuitive and Polars integrates well with other Python libraries from the scientific programming toolbox.
