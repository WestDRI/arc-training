This section offers a few takeaways on coding with LLMs. Models are evolving so fast that these are likely to be wrong within years, months, or maybe even weeks, so take them for what they are!

## Importance of education

However one might feel about AI and its ethical implications (and there are many!), it is important, as citizens and researchers, to be educated on the topic.

Being able to use AI is critical as those who don't will likely increasingly be at a disadvantage.

## Critical thinking

Be critical and don't blindly trust the code. Double-check everything. The LLM will "happily" tell you that the code is doing something while it is not.

Code can be wrong in ways that are obvious in simple situations or in ways that are much less obvious in more complex problems. It can even be harmful.

## Constructive use

Use an LLM as an assistant and instructor to brainstorm with and learn from, not as a magic box that will do everything for you. They do make coding a lot easier and will make you able to write useful Python code a lot sooner, but you still have to think and learn.

The more Python you know, the easier it will get to be critical of the code. Don't hesitate to use LLMs to explain the code to you. They will help you learn.
