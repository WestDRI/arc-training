## Installation

### Personal computer

```{.bash}
python -m venv ~/env                  # Create virtual env
source ~/env/bin/activate             # Activate virtual env
pip install --upgrade pip             # Update pip
pip install polars          		  # Install Polars
```

### Alliance clusters

Polars wheels are available for Polars (always prefer wheels when possible):

```{.bash}
python -m venv ~/env                  # Create virtual env
source ~/env/bin/activate             # Activate virtual env
pip install --upgrade pip --no-index  # Update pip from wheel
pip install polars --no-index		  # Install Polars from wheel
```

## Syntax

Overall, the syntax feels somewhat similar to [R's dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html) from [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

## Performance tips

Use lazy execution where possible.

A great file format is the [Apache Parquet](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/parquet.html) format.

## Migrating from Pandas

Read [the migration guide](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/migration/pandas/#selecting-data): it will help you write Polars code rather than "literally translated" Pandas code that runs, but doesn't make use of Polars' strengths. The differences in style mostly come from the fact that Polars runs in parallel.
