## Integration with other tools

*As good as Pandas' (except for cuDF, still in development)*

- *With NumPy:* see [the documentation](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/expressions/numpy/), the [from_numpy](https://docs.pola.rs/py-polars/html/reference/api/polars.from_numpy.html) and [to_numpy](https://docs.pola.rs/py-polars/html/reference/dataframe/api/polars.DataFrame.to_numpy.html) functions, [the development progress of this integration](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/14334), and [performance advice](https://kevinheavey.github.io/modern-polars/performance.html#numpy-can-make-polars-faster)

- *Parallel computing:* with [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/26131) thanks to [this setting](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/api/data_context.html#ray.data.DataContext); with Spark, Dask, and Ray thanks to [fugue](https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue/)

- *GPUs:* with the [cuDF library](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) from [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/) (in development)

- *SQL:* with [DuckDB](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb)
