For better or for worse, Python has been one of the most popular programming languages for the past 20 years. During that period, it has increasingly become a key language for data science. Its prevalence was further consolidated by the advent of deep learning since the most popular frameworks were released as Python libraries.

This introductory course will walk you through the basics of programming in Python. We will cover the main language features: variables and data types, conditionals, lists, for/while loops, list comprehensions, dictionaries, and writing functions.
