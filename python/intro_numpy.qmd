[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is a Python library written in C, Python, and C++ that adds support for the mathematical manipulation of large multidimensional arrays. It is the library that brought Python to the scientific community and many scientific packages rely on it.

This introductory course does not leave us enough time to cover NumPy, but [the official NumPy website](https://numpy.org/) contains [an excellent and extensive documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/).
