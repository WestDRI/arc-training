## What are LLMs?

[Large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) 

## LLMs and code

While LLMs are capable of producing human language, they are particularly good at writing code.

## Which LLM to use?

This is a purely personal decision.

The field is wide and fast evolving. Some services are free, others (with newer and better models) require subscriptions. Different models have different styles and some perform better than others in some contexts, but the competition is tight. Some models are open-source (e.g. [Llama](https://www.llama.com/) and [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/)) while most are for the moment closed-source.

As of 2025, popular options include various versions of the following models (in random order and non-exhaustively):

- [le Chat](https://chat.mistral.ai/chat) by [Mistral AI](https://console.mistral.ai/home),
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) by [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/),
- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/) by OpenAI,
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/) by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/),
- [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/) by [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/),
- [Llama](https://www.llama.com/) by [Meta](https://www.meta.com/).

Companies such as [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/) also provide search engines that can use a multitude of the above models under the hood.

## How to use an LLM for coding?

LLMs can be used for a variety of tasks. In particular, they can:

- explain code,
- explain programming concepts,
- write well-documented code,
- debug code.
