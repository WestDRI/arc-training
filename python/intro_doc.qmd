## Help and documentation

### Module

You can get help on a module thanks to the `help` function, but only after you have loaded that module into your session:

```{.python}
import os
help(os)
```

```
Help on module os:

NAME
    os - OS routines for NT or Posix depending on what system we're on.

MODULE REFERENCE
    https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/os.html

    The following documentation is automatically generated from the Python
    source files.  It may be incomplete, incorrect or include features that
    are considered implementation detail and may vary between Python
    implementations.  When in doubt, consult the module reference at the
    location listed above.

...
```

### Functions

You can also access the internal Python documentation on a function with `help`:

```{python}
help(max)
```

:::{.note}

In Jupyter, you can also use `?max` or `max?`.

:::

Alternatively, you can print the `__doc__` method of the function:

```{python}
print(max.__doc__)
```

### Methods of object types

Some methods belong to specific objects types (e.g. lists have a method called `append`).

In those cases, `help(<method>)` won't work.

:::{.example}

Example:

:::

```{python}
help(append)
```

What you need to run instead is `help(<object>.<method>)`.

:::{.example}

Example:

:::

```{python}
help(list.append)
```
