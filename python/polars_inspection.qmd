:::{.def}

Once we have a data frame, it is important to quickly get some basic information about it. In this section, we will see how to do so.

:::

Let's start by reading an online CSV file from a URL:

```{python}
import polars as pl

df = pl.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razoumov/publish/master/jeopardy.csv")
print(df)
```

## Printing a few rows

Print first rows (5 by default):

```{python}
print(df.head())
```

```{python}
print(df.head(2))
```

Print last rows (5 by default):

```{python}
print(df.tail(2))
```

Print random rows (this is very useful as the head and tail of your data frame may not be representative of your data):

```{python}
import random

print(df.sample(4))
```

## Structure

Overview of the data frame and its structure:

```{python}
print(df.glimpse())
```

:::{.note}

This is similar to the `str()` function in R.

:::

## Summary statistics

This is not always meaningful depending on your data:

```{python}
print(df.describe())
```
