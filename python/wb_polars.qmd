author: Marie-Hélène Burle

:::{.def}

[Polars](https://pola.rs/) is a modern open source and *very fast* DataFrame framework for Python, Rust, JS, R, and Ruby.

In this webinar, I will demo Polars for Python and show how much faster it is compared to [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) while remaining just as convenient.
