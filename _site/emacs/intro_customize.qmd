### Customizing modes

In Emacs, **everything** is customizable

To customize modes, you can write Emacs Lisp code in your [init file](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html) (the configuration file that gets loaded when Emacs launches) or you can use the [easy customization interface](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html)

:::{.example}

For example, to customize the Markdown major mode, you would run `M-x customize-group markdown`

:::

### Evaluation order

If you write your own Emacs code, be careful that functions and variables take the value of their last loaded version. The order in which Emacs code is evaluated thus matters

You want to evaluate as little as possible when you launch Emacs to speed up start-up time (lazy evaluation): you don't want to load every single package that you have installed

This means that if you overwrite a function or variable of a mode in your init file, the init file is read at start-up, but when that mode is launched, the default function/variable will overwrite the custom one you wrote in your init file

### Evaluation order

To by-pass this problem, you can use `eval-after-load`

:::{.example}

Example:

```{.lisp}
(eval-after-load
 "markdown"
 '(defun markdown-demote ()
    ...))
```

:::

:::{.note}

[use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) has the `:init` and `:config` keyword symbols that ensure that the following expressions are evaluated respectively before or after the loading of a package

### Customizing kbd

Most modes come with specific [keymaps](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Keymaps.html): sets of kbd only active when the mode is enabled. These kbd of course can be customized

:::{.example}

For example, to modify the kbd for the function `markdown-outline-previous` in the `markdown-mode-map`:

:::

```{.lisp}
(define-key markdown-mode-map (kbd "M-p") 'markdown-outline-previous)
```

:::{.example}

Or, using [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package):

:::

```{.lisp}
(use-package markdown-mode
	:bind (:map markdown-mode-map
				("M-p" . markdown-outline-previous)))
```
