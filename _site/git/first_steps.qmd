## Git commands

All commands start with `git`.

A typical command is of the form:

```
git <command> [flags] [arguments]
```

:::{.example}

Example:

:::

```{.bash}
git config --global "Your Name"
```






## Let's create a mock project

Let's imagine that you have been working on chapter 3 of your thesis for some time, without using a version control system. We will put that chapter under version control and see how you should work from now on.

First, we need to create a mock set of documents.

1. Navigate to a suitable location

```{.bash}
cd </some/suitable/location/in/your/computer>
```

2. Create the directory at the root of chapter 3

```{.bash}
mkdir chapter3
```

:::{.example}

Make sure not to use any spaces in the name: Git doesn't work well with spaces.

:::

3. Create a number of subdirectories

```{.bash}
mkdir chapter3/src chapter3/ms chapter3/data chapter3/results
```

4. Create a mock manuscript

```{.bash}
echo "# Chapter 3
## Introduction
Bla bla bla bla bla.
## Methods
Bla bla bla." > chapter3/ms/chapter3.md
```

:::{.example}

Git can only version text files. If you write your papers or thesis chapter in text files (e.g. markdown, LaTeX, org-mode), you will be able to put them under version control, which is really convenient. If you use a word processor, you won't be able to.

:::

5. Create a mock R script

```{.bash}
echo "library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

df <- data.frame(
  x = (1:5),
  y = (1:5)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()" > chapter3/src/chapter3.R
```

:::{.example}

Even if you use a word processor for your writing, your scripts (e.g. in Python, R, etc.) will be written in text files. So you will always be able to put at least those files under version control.

:::

## Initializing a Git repository

[Make sure to enter the project before initializing the repository.]{.emph}

```{.bash}
cd chapter3
```

Now, you can run the command that will turn your `chapter3` directory into a Git repository:

```{.bash}
git init
```

````
Initialized empty Git repository in chapter3/.git/
````

:::{.example}

Git is very verbose: you will often get useful feed-back after running commands.

:::

When you run this command, Git creates a `.git` repository. This is where it will store all its files.

You can see that this repository was created by running:

```{.bash}
ls -a
```

````
.
..
.git
data
ms
results
src
````

:::{.example}

If you run `git init` in the wrong location, you can easily fix this: simply delete the `.git` directory that you created!

:::

## Creating commits

You can think of a commit as a snapshot of a particular version of your project.

You should create a new commit whenever you think that your project is at a point to which you might want to go back to.

Let's create a first commit with the state of our chapter 3 before we do any more work to it:

```{.bash}
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

````
[main (root-commit) 24duu7i] Initial commit
 2 files changed, 18 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 ms/chapter3.md
 create mode 100644 src/chapter3.R
````

To create a commit, we first need to add the file(s) we want to add to our commit to the staging area (also called "index"). This is done with the command `git add`. To add all the files, we can use `git add .` (`.` represents the current directory).

Once we have added some files to the staging area, we can create a commit. But each commit has a message associated to it. One way to add this message is to use the command to create commits (`git commit`) with the `-m` flag (for "message"). Here, our message is simply "Initial commit".

:::{.info}

Git saves the history of a project as a series of snapshots:

![](img/01.png)

Those snapshots are called commits:

![](img/02.png)

Each commit is identified by a unique *hash* and contains these metadata:

- author,
- date and time,
- the hash of parent commit(s),
- a message.

As soon as you create the first commit, a pointer called a *branch* is created and it points to that commit. By default, that first branch is called `main`:

![](img/03.png)

Another pointer (`HEAD`) points to the branch `main`. `HEAD` indicates where we are in the project history.

:::

We can now do some work in our chapter 3. For instance, let's imagine that we are adding a result section to our chapter3.md file.

```{.bash}
echo "
## Results

We now have a bunch of results in our markdown manuscript." >> ms/chapter3.md
```

[Make sure to use `>>` here and not `>`: `>>` prepends content while `>` replaces any existing content.]{.emph}

If this new addition is important enough to justify making a new commit (how often you commit is up to you), we can do so:

```{.bash}
git add ms/chapter3.md
git commit -m "Add result section to manuscript"
```

````
[main 451c47b] Add result section to manuscript
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
````

:::{.info}

As you create more commits, the history of your project grows ...

![](img/04.png)

... and the pointers `HEAD` and `main` automatically move to the last commit:

![](img/05.png)

For simplicity, the diagrams can be simplified this way:

### Advice for great commit messages
<br>
![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git_commit.png){fig-alt="noshadow"}

:::{.caption}

from [xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com/)

:::

- Use the present tense
- The first line is a summary of the commit and is less than 50 characters long
- Leave a blank line below
- Then add the body of your commit message with more details

:::{.example}

Example of a good commit message:

:::

```{.bash}
git commit -m "Reduce boundary conditions by a factor of 0.3

Update boundaries
Rerun model and update table
Rephrase method section in ms"
```

Future you will thank you! (And so will your collaborators).

## Understanding the staging area

New Git users are often confused about the two-step commit process (first, you stage with `git add`, then you commit with `git commit`). This intermediate step seems, at first, totally unnecessary. In fact, it is very useful: without it, commits would always include all new changes made to a project and they would thus be very messy. The staging area allows to prepare ("stage") the next commit. This way, you only commit what you want when you want.

:::{.example}

Let's go over a simple example:

:::

We don't always work linearly. Maybe you are working on a section of your manuscript when you realize by chance that there is a mistake in your script. You fix that mistake. On your next commit, it might make little sense to commit together that fix and your manuscript changes since they are not related. If your commits are random bag of changes, it will be very hard for future you to navigate your project history.

It is a lot better to only stage your script fix, commit it, then only stage your manuscript update, and commit this in a different commit.

The staging area allows you to pick and chose the changes from one or various files that constitute some coherent change to the project and that make sense to commit together.

## Inspecting changes

### List of modified files

One command you will run often when working with Git is `git status`:

```{.bash}
git status
```

````
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
````

This means that we are on the branch `main` (that's the only branch in our repo at this point) and that all changes to our project have been committed.

Let's modify a file and see what happens:

```{.bash}
echo "
## Conclusion

And finally, the great conclusion of our paper." >> ms/chapter3.md
```

```{.bash}
git status
```

````
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   ms/chapter3.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
````

Let's modify another file:

```{.bash}
echo "
a = 23" >> src/chapter3.R
```

```{.bash}
git status
```

````
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   ms/chapter3.md
        modified:   src/chapter3.R

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
````

Maybe we don't want to create a commit with all those changes, so we only stage the changes made to the manuscript:

```{.bash}
git add ms/chapter3.md
```

Then we check the status of our repository again:

```{.bash}
git status
```

````
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   ms/chapter3.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   src/chapter3.R
````

If we ran `git commit` at this point, we would create a new commit with the changes made to the manuscript.

### List of actual changes

While `git status` gives us the list of new files and files with changes, it doesn't allow us to see what those changes are. For this, we need a new command: `git diff`.

#### Differences between the working directory and the index

`git diff` shows the difference between the working directory (our actual files) and the index (staging area):

```{.bash}
git diff
```

````
diff --git a/src/chapter3.R b/src/chapter3.R
index 95f1592..2bf030d 100644

+++ b/src/chapter3.R
@@ -7,3 +7,5 @@ df <- data.frame(
 )

 ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
+
+a = 23
````

This allows us to see that src/chapter3.R has a new line (`a = 23`) and that it is not yet staged.

#### Differences between the index and your last commit

To see what would be committed if you ran `git commit` (so, to see the difference between the index and the last commit), you need to run instead:

```{.bash}
git diff --cached
```

````
diff --git a/ms/chapter3.md b/ms/chapter3.md

This shows us the changes that we have staged but not yet committed (the changes to our manuscript).

#### Differences between the working directory and your last commit

This means, both of the above. This can been displayed with:

```{.bash}
git diff HEAD
```

Now, let's clean up our working directory by creating two new commits:

```{.bash}
git commit -m "Add conclusion to the manuscript"
```

````

 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
````

```{.bash}
git add .
git commit -m "Define the variable a in R script"
```

````

````

If we look at the status of our repository now, we can see that it is clean again:

```{.bash}
git status
```

````
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
````

## Ignoring

Not everything should be under version control. For instance, you don't want to put under version control non-text files or your initial data. You also shouldn't put under version control documents that can be easily recreated such as graphs and script outputs.

However, you don't want to have such documents constantly showing up when you run `git status`. In order to have a clean working directory while keeping them out of version control, you can create a file called `.gitignore` and add to it a list of files or patterns that you want Git to disregard.

For instance:

```{.bash}
echo "/data/
/results/" > .gitignore
```

This creates a `.gitignore` file with two entries (`/data/` and `/results/`) and from now on, any file in either of these directories will be ignored by Git.

The `.gitignore` is a file like any other file, so you'll want to stage and commit it:

```{.bash}
git status
```

````
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
````

```{.bash}
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore file with data and results"
```

````
[main a1df8e5] Add .gitignore file with data and results
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
````

```{.bash}
git status
```

````
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
````

## Displaying the commit history

So far, we have created 5 commits. To display them, you use the command `git log`:

```{.bash}
git log
```

## Getting information about a commit

`git log` is useful to get an overview of our project history, but the information we get about each commit is limited. To get additional information about a particular commit, you can use `git show` followed by the hash of the commit you are interested about.

For instance, let's explore our second commit:

```{.bash}
git show 451c47b  # Replace the hash by the hash of your second commit
```

````

In addition to displaying the commit metadata, this also displays the difference with the previous commit.

## Revisiting old commits

The pointer `HEAD`, which normally points to the branch `main` which itself points to latest commit, can be moved around. By moving `HEAD` to any commit, you can revisit the state of your project at that particular version.

The command for this is `git checkout` followed by the hash of the commit you want to revisit.

:::{.example}

For instance, we could revisit the first commit in our example with:

:::

```{.bash}
git checkout 24duu7i  # Replace the hash by the hash of your first commit
```

````
Note: switching to '24duu7i'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 24duu7i Initial commit
````

:::{.example}

This is the same as the command `git switch --detach 24duu7i`: `git switch` is a command introduced a few years ago because `git checkout` can be used for many things in Git and it was confusing many users. `git switch` allows to switch from one branch to another or, with the `--detach` flag, to switch to a commit as is the case here.

:::

Once you have seen what you wanted to see, you can go back to your branch `main` with:

```{.bash}
git checkout main
```

````
Previous HEAD position was 24duu7i Initial commit
Switched to branch 'main'
````

:::{.example}

This is the same as the command `git switch main`.

:::

[Be careful not to forget to go back to your branch `main` before making changes to your project. If you want to move the project to a new direction from some old commit, you need to create a new branch before doing so. When `HEAD` points directly to a commit (and not to a branch), this is called "Detached HEAD" and it is not a position from which you want to modify the project.]{.emph}

:::{.info}

It is totally fine to move `HEAD` around and have it point directly to a commit (instead of a branch) as long as you are only looking at a version of your project and get back to a branch before doing some work:

:::

## Branches

One of the reasons Git has become so popular is its branch system.

Remember that little pointer called `main`? That's our main branch: the one Git creates automatically when we create our first commit.

A branch in Git is just that: a little pointer. This makes creating branches extremely quick and cheap. But they are extremely convenient.

Instead of checking out a commit as we just saw (which creates a detached HEAD state), we can instead create a new branch on that commit and switch to it with:

```{.bash}
git switch -c newbranch 24duu7i
```

````
Switched to a new branch 'newbranch'
````

This creates a new branch called `newbranch` on our first commit and switches `HEAD` to it. If you do this instead of entering a detached HEAD state, it is totally safe to make chang
es and create commits from there. You can easily switch `HEAD` back and forth between the two branches with:

```{.bash}
git switch main        # Moves HEAD back to the branch main
```

````
Switched to branch 'main'
````

```{.bash}
git switch newbranch
```

````
Switched to branch 'newbranch'
````

```{.bash}
git status
```

````
On branch newbranch
nothing to commit, working tree clean
````

If you already checked out the commit `24duu7i` with `git checkout 24duu7i`, you can create the new branch `newbranch` on that commit and switch to it with:

```{.bash}
git switch -c newbranch
```

````
Switched to a new branch 'newbranch'
````

Those are equivalent workflows. Just don't forget never to work from a detached HEAD state. You can look around in that state, but that's it. Why? Because commits that are not part of a branch get automatically deleted on a regular basis when Git runs its garbage collection. So any commits you make from a detached HEAD will eventually be lost. And that's probably not what you want.

In short, `git switch` allows you to switch `HEAD` from one branch to another. With the `-c` flag, you can create a new branch before switching to it. And by adding some starting point such as a commit, the new branch gets created on that commit rather than on the position of `HEAD`.

Now, have a look at what happens if you run git log from `newbranch`:

```{.bash}
git log
```

Horror! It looks like all our commits except for the first one are gone!

In fact, they still exist, but by default, `git log` only shows what is on the current branch. To see all the commits that are on any branch in your project, you need to add the `--all` flag:

```{.bash}
git log --all

### Merging branches

If you want to merge branches, switch to the branch you want to merge into the other one, then run `git merge`.

For instance, if we want to merge `newbranch` onto `main`, we would first switch to `newbranch` (we are already on it, so nothing to do here), then:

```{.bash}
git merge main
```

This merge is called a "fast-forward" merge because `main` and `newbranch` had not diverged. It was simply a question of having `newbranch` catch up to `main`.

If you run `git log` again, you will see that `newbrach` has now caught up with `main`:

```{.bash}
git log
```

**Here is a classic situation of fast-forward merge.**

Instead of working on your branch `main`, you create a test branch and work on it (so `HEAD` is on the branch `test` and both move along as you create commits):

![](img/14.png)

![](img/15.png)

![](img/16.png)

When you are happy with the changes you made on your test branch, you decide to merge `main` onto it.

First, you switch to `main`:

![](img/17.png)

Then you do the fast-forward merge from `main` onto `test` (so `main` catches up to `test`):

![](img/18.png)

Then, usually, you delete the branch `test` as it has served its purpose (with `git branch -d test`). Alternatively, you can switch back to it and do the next bit of experimental work in it.
This allows to keep `main` free of possible mishaps and bad developments (if you aren't happy with the work you did on your test branch, you can simply delete it and Git will clean the commits that are on it but not on `main` during the next garbage collection.

:::

If the branches have diverged (you created commits from both `main` and `newbranch`), the merge would require the creation of an additional commit called a "merge commit".

:::{.info}

**Here is a classic situation of merge with a commit.**

You create a test branch and switch to it:

![](img/21.png)

Then you create some commits:

![](img/22.png)

![](img/23.png)

Now you switch back to `main`:

![](img/24.png)

And you create commits from `main` too:

![](img/25.png)

![](img/26.png)

To merge your main branch and your test branch, a new commit is now required (note that the command is the same as in the case of a fast-forward merge: `git merge`. Git will create the new commit automatically. As long as there is no conflict, it is just as easy as a fast-forward merge. We will talk later about resolving conflicts).

![](img/27.png)

After which, you can delete the (now useless) test branch (with `git branch -d test2`):

### Resolving conflicts

Git works line by line. As long as you aren't working on the same line(s) of the same file(s) on different branches, there will not be any merging difficulty. If however you modified one or more of the same line(s) of the same file(s) on different branches, Git has no way to decide which version should be kept and will thus not be able to complete the merge. It will then ask you to resolve the conflict(s). Conveniently, it will list the file(s) containing the conflict(s).

There are fancy tools to resolve conflicts, but you can do it in any text editor: simply open the file(s) listed by Git as having conflicts and look for the following markers:

````
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is your version.
=======
This is the alternative version of the same section of the file.
>>>>>>> alternative version
````

These markers are added by Git to signal the areas of conflict. It is up to you to choose between the two versions (or create a third one) and remove the conflict markers. After that, you can stage the file(s) which contained the conflicts to finish the merge (and then you can commit).

## Troubleshooting

### "Listen" to Git!

Git is extremely verbose: by default, it will return lots of information. Read it!

These messages may feel overwhelming at first, but:

- they will make more and more sense as you gain expertise,
- they often give you clues as to what the problem is,
- even if you don't understand them, you can use them as Google search terms.

### (Re-read) the doc

As I have no memory, I need to check the man pages all the time. That's ok! It is quick and easy.

For more detailed information and examples, I really like [the Official Git manual](https://git-scm.com/docs).

### Search online

- Google
- [Stack Overflow [git] tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git)

### Don't panic

Be analytical. It is easy to panic and feel lost if something doesn't work as expected. Take a breath and start with the basis:

- make sure you are in the repo (`pwd`) and the files are where you think they are (`ls -a`),
- inspect the repository (`git status`, `git diff`, `git log`). Make sure not to overlook what Git is "telling" you there.

## Conclusion

Git is a powerful and fairly complex tool, but you don't have to master it entirely to start using it. Start by putting your projects (e.g. thesis chapters, papers) under version control and by creating commits whenever you reach important stages in your work.

Things will grow from there.
