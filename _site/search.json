It extends Bash’s capabilities.\nAnother shell in the same family is the KornShell (ksh).\nAll these shells are quite similar. The C shell (csh) however was modeled on the C programming language.\nBash is the most common shell and the one which makes the most sense to learn as a first Unix shell.\n\n\n\nWhy use a shell?\nWhile automating GUI operations is really difficult, it is easy to rerun a script (a file with a number of commands). Unix shells thus allow the creation of reproducible workflows and the automation of repetitive tasks.\nThey are powerful to launch tools, modify files, search text, or combine commands.\nThey also allow to work on remote machines and HPC systems."

    "text": "How we will use Bash today\nBash is a Unix shell. You thus need a Unix or Unix-like operating system.\nWe will connect to a remote HPC system via SSH (secure shell). HPC systems always run Linux.\nThose on Linux or MacOS can alternatively use Bash directly on their machine. On MacOS, the default is now zsh (you can see that by typing echo $SHELL in Terminal), but zsh is fully compatible with Bash commands, so it is totally fine to use it instead. If you really want to use Bash, simply launch it by typing in Terminal: bash.\n\nConnecting to a remote HPC system via SSH\n\nUsernames and password\nWe will give you a link to an etherpad during the workshop. Add your name next to a free username to claim it.\nWe will also give you the password for our training cluster. When prompted, enter it.\n\nNote that you will not see any character as you type the password: this is called blind typing and is a Linux safety feature. Type slowly and make sure not to make typos. It can be unsettling at first not to get any feed-back while typing.\n\n\n\nLinux and MacOS users\nLinux users: open the terminal emulator of your choice.\nMacOS users: open “Terminal”.\nThen type:\nssh userxx@bashworkshop.c3.ca  # Replace userxx by your username (e.g. user09)\n\n\nWindows users\nWe suggest using the free version of MobaXterm.\nMobaXterm comes with a terminal emulator and a GUI interface for SSH sessions.\nOpen MobaXterm, click on “Session”, then “SSH”, and fill in the Remote host name and your username.

It is the way to escape single quotes in single-quoted strings.\nThe first ' ends the first string, both \" create a double-quoted string with ' (escaped) in it, then the last ' starts the second string.\nEscaping double quotes is a lot easier and simply requires \\\".\n\n\n\nExpanding a variable’s value\nTo expand a variable (to access its value), you need to prepend its name with $:\n\nvariable=Test\necho variable\n\nvariable\n\n\nMmmm… not really want we want!\n\nvariable=Test\necho $variable\n\nTest\n\n\n\nvariable=Test; echo \"$variable\"\n\nTest\n\n\n!!

Be very careful that rm is irreversible. Deleted files do not go to the trash: they are gone."

This allows you to jump back and forth between various alternatives.\nYou can work on different aspects of the project on different branches. This prevents having messy incomplete work all over the place on the same branch.\nIf you want to revisit an old commit, you can create a branch there and switch to it instead of moving HEAD (creating a detached HEAD situation). This way, if you decide to create new commits from that old one, you don’t risk loosing them.\nBranches are great for collaboration: each person can work on their own branch and merge it back to the main branch when they are done with one section of a project.\n\nAnd since branches are so cheap to create, there is no downside to their creation."

You can choose any name, but since Git automatically call the remote origin when you clone a repo, it is common practice to use origin as the name for the first remote.\n\nExample (using an SSH address):\n\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:<user>/<repo>.git\n\nExample (using an HTTPS address):\n\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git\nIf you don’t want to grant others write access to the project, and you only accept contributions through pull requests, you are set.\nIf you want to grant your collaborators write access to the project however, you need to add them to it.\n\n\n\nInvite collaborators\n\nGo to your GitHub project page.\nClick on the Settings tab.\nClick on the Manage access section on the left-hand side (you will be prompted for your GitHub password).\nClick on the Invite a collaborator green button.\nInvite your collaborators with one of their GitHub user name, their email address, or their full name.\n\n\n\n\n(2) Write access to project\nIn this second situation, someone else started a project and they are inviting you to collaborate to it, giving you write access to the project.\nIn this case, you need to clone the project: cd to the location where you want your local copy, then:\ngit clone <remote-address> <local-name>\nThis sets the project as a remote to your new local copy and that remote is automatically called origin.\nWithout <local-name>, the repo will have the name of the last part of the remote address.\n\n\n(3) No write access to project\nIn this third situation, someone else started a project and you want to collaborate to it, but you do not have write access to it.\nIn this case, you will have to submit pull requests.\nHere is the workflow for a pull request (PR):\n\nFork the project on GitHub.\nClone your fork on your machine.\nAdd the initial project as a second remote & call it upstream.\nPull from upstream to update your local project.\nCreate & checkout a new branch.\nMake & commit your changes on that branch.\nPush that branch to your fork (i.e. origin — remember that you do not have write access to upstream).\nGo to the original project GitHub’s page & open a pull request."

How does this work?\nTo upload your changes to the remote on GitHub you push to it with git push.\nIf one of your collaborators has made changes to the remote (pushing from their own local version of the project), you won’t be able to push. Instead, you will get the following message:\nTo xxx.git\n ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)\nerror: failed to push some refs to 'xxx.git'\nhint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do\nhint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing\nhint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes\nhint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.\nhint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.\nThe solution?\nYou first have to download (git pull) their work onto your machine, merge it with yours (which will happen automatically if there are no conflicts), before you can push your work to GitHub.\nNow… what if there are conflicts?\n\n\nResolving conflicts\n\n\nFrom crystallize.com\n\nGit works line by line. As long as your collaborators and you aren’t working on the same line(s) of the same file(s) at the same time, there will not be any problem. If however you modified one or more of the same line(s) of the same file(s), Git will not be able to decide which version should be kept. When you git pull their work on your machine, the automatic merging will get interrupted and Git will ask you to resolve the conflict(s) before the merge can resume. It will conveniently tell you which file(s) contain the conflict(s).\nThere are fancy tools to resolve conflicts, but you can do it in any text editor: simply open the file(s) listed by Git as having conflicts and look for the following markers:\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nThis is your version.\n=======\nThis is the alternative version of the same section of the file.\n>>>>>>> alternative version\nThese markers are added by Git to signal the areas of conflict. It is up to you to choose between the two versions (or create a third one) and remove the conflict markers. After that, you can stage the file(s) which contained the conflicts to finish the merge (and then you can commit)."

    "text": "Forking a project\nNow, a more advanced approach is to actually make changes to the code of the project.\nIf you want to develop your own version of the project, you can fork the GitHub repository: go to GitHub and fork the project by clicking on the “Fork” button in the top right corner.\nYou have all privileges on the forked project. So you can make any change you want there. You can clone it to your machine and develop the fork. But your fork does not get updated to the improvements made to the initial project. It is an independent project of its own.\n\nKeeping a fork up to date\nIf you want to keep your fork up to date with the initial project, you need to:\n\n1. Clone your fork on your machine\nThis will automatically set your fork on GitHub as the remote called origin:\n# If you have set SSH for your GitHub account\ngit clone git@github.com:<user>/<repo>.git <name>\n\n# If you haven't set SSH\ngit clone https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git <name>\n\n\n2. Add the initial project as upstream\nAdd a second remote, this one pointing to the initial project. It is usual to call this remote upstream:\n# If you have set SSH for your GitHub account\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:<user>/<repo>.git\n\n# If you haven't set SSH\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git\n\n\n3. Pull from upstream\nYou can now pull from upstream to keep your fork up to date.\nFrom there on, you can pull from and push to origin (your fork) and you can pull from upstream (the initial repo).\nOf course, if your project and the initial one diverge in places, this will lead to conflicts that you will have to resolve as you merge the pulls from upstream.\nMost of the time however, you don’t want to develop your own version of the project. Instead, you want to make the initial project better by contributing to it. But you can’t push changes to upstream directly since you are not part of that project. You don’t have write access to that repository. If anybody could push to any project, that would be utter chaos.\nSo how do you contribute code to someone else’s project?"

Note that after you have pushed your branch to origin, GitHub will automatically offer you to do so.\n\nThe maintainer of the initial project may accept or decline the PR. They may also make comments and ask you to make changes. If so, make new changes and push additional commits to that branch until they are happy with the change.\nOnce the PR is merged by the maintainer, you can delete the branch on your fork and pull from upstream to update your local fork with the recently accepted changes."

This allows for offline work, huge speedups, easy branching, and multiple backups. DVCS have taken over CVCS.\nIf the trends of Google searches of the existing version control systems are any indication of their popularity, we can say that Git has crushed the competition since 2010.\n\n\nNowadays, it is indeed extremely rare to come across any other version control system.\nGit is simply that good 🙂"

This is done with the command git add. To add all the files, we can use git add . (. represents the current directory).\nOnce we have added some files to the staging area, we can create a commit. But each commit has a message associated to it. One way to add this message is to use the command to create commits (git commit) with the -m flag (for “message”). Here, our message is simply “Initial commit”.\n\nGit saves the history of a project as a series of snapshots:\n\nThose snapshots are called commits:\n\nEach commit is identified by a unique hash and contains these metadata:\n\nauthor,\ndate and time,\nthe hash of parent commit(s),\na message.\n\nAs soon as you create the first commit, a pointer called a branch is created and it points to that commit. By default, that first branch is called main:\n\nAnother pointer (HEAD) points to the branch main. HEAD indicates where we are in the project history.\n\nWe can now do some work in our chapter 3.

This intermediate step seems, at first, totally unnecessary. In fact, it is very useful: without it, commits would always include all new changes made to a project and they would thus be very messy. The staging area allows to prepare (“stage”) the next commit. This way, you only commit what you want when you want.\n\nLet’s go over a simple example:\n\nWe don’t always work linearly. Maybe you are working on a section of your manuscript when you realize by chance that there is a mistake in your script. You fix that mistake. On your next commit, it might make little sense to commit together that fix and your manuscript changes since they are not related. If your commits are random bag of changes, it will be very hard for future you to navigate your project history.\nIt is a lot better to only stage your script fix, commit it, then only stage your manuscript update, and commit this in a different commit.\nThe staging area allows you to pick and chose the changes from one or various files that constitute some coherent change to the project and that make sense to commit together."

By moving HEAD to any commit, you can revisit the state of your project at that particular version.\nThe command for this is git checkout followed by the hash of the commit you want to revisit.\n\nFor instance, we could revisit the first commit in our example with:\n\ngit checkout 24duu7i  # Replace the hash by the hash of your first commit\nNote: switching to '24duu7i'.\n\nYou are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental\nchanges and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this\nstate without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.\n\nIf you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may\ndo so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:\n\n  git switch -c <new-branch-name>\n\nOr undo this operation with:\n\n  git switch -\n\nTurn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false\n\nHEAD is now at 24duu7i Initial commit\n\nThis is the same as the command git switch --detach 24duu7i: git switch is a command introduced a few years ago because git checkout can be used for many things in Git and it was confusing many users. git switch allows to switch from one branch to another or, with the --detach flag, to switch to a commit as is the case here.\n\nOnce you have seen what you wanted to see, you can go back to your branch main with:\ngit checkout main\nPrevious HEAD position was 24duu7i Initial commit\nSwitched to branch 'main'\n\nThis is the same as the command git switch main.\n\nBe careful not to forget to go back to your branch main before making changes to your project. If you want to move the project to a new direction from some old commit, you need to create a new branch before doing so. When HEAD points directly to a commit (and not to a branch), this is called “Detached HEAD” and it is not a position from which you want to modify the project.\n\nIt is totally fine to move HEAD around and have it point directly to a commit (instead of a branch) as long as you are only looking at a version of your project and get back to a branch before doing some work:"

    "section": "Branches",
    "text": "Branches\nOne of the reasons Git has become so popular is its branch system.\nRemember that little pointer called main? That’s our main branch: the one Git creates automatically when we create our first commit.\nA branch in Git is just that: a little pointer. This makes creating branches extremely quick and cheap. But they are extremely convenient.\nInstead of checking out a commit as we just saw (which creates a detached HEAD state), we can instead create a new branch on that commit and switch to it with:\ngit switch -c newbranch 24duu7i\nSwitched to a new branch 'newbranch'\nThis creates a new branch called newbranch on our first commit and switches HEAD to it. If you do this instead of entering a detached HEAD state, it is totally safe to make chang es and create commits from there. You can easily switch HEAD back and forth between the two branches with:\ngit switch main        # Moves HEAD back to the branch main\nSwitched to branch 'main'\ngit switch newbranch\nSwitched to branch 'newbranch'\ngit status\nOn branch newbranch\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\nIf you already checked out the commit 24duu7i with git checkout 24duu7i, you can create the new branch newbranch on that commit and switch to it with:\ngit switch -c newbranch\nSwitched to a new branch 'newbranch'\nThose are equivalent workflows. Just don’t forget never to work from a detached HEAD state. You can look around in that state, but that’s it. Why? Because commits that are not part of a branch get automatically deleted on a regular basis when Git runs its garbage collection. So any commits you make from a detached HEAD will eventually be lost. And that’s probably not what you want.\nIn short, git switch allows you to switch HEAD from one branch to another. With the -c flag, you can create a new branch before switching to it. And by adding some starting point such as a commit, the new branch gets created on that commit rather than on the position of HEAD.\nNow, have a look at what happens if you run git log from newbranch:\ngit log\ncommit 24duu7id631a7390a910fa13cd4954cf9e8a3061 (HEAD -> newbranch)\nAuthor: Marie-Helene Burle <xxx@xxx>\nDate:   Mon Oct 3 18:19:28 2022 -0700\n\n    Initial commit\nHorror!

Alternatively, you can switch back to it and do the next bit of experimental work in it. This allows to keep main free of possible mishaps and bad developments (if you aren’t happy with the work you did on your test branch, you can simply delete it and Git will clean the commits that are on it but not on main during the next garbage collection.\n\n\nIf the branches have diverged (you created commits from both main and newbranch), the merge would require the creation of an additional commit called a “merge commit”.\n\nHere is a classic situation of merge with a commit.\nYou create a test branch and switch to it:\n\nThen you create some commits:\n\n\nNow you switch back to main:\n\nAnd you create commits from main too:\n\n\nTo merge your main branch and your test branch, a new commit is now required (note that the command is the same as in the case of a fast-forward merge: git merge. Git will create the new commit automatically. As long as there is no conflict, it is just as easy as a fast-forward merge. We will talk later about resolving conflicts).\n\nAfter which, you can delete the (now useless) test branch (with git branch -d test2):\n\n\n\n\nResolving conflicts\nGit works line by line. As long as you aren’t working on the same line(s) of the same file(s) on different branches, there will not be any merging difficulty. If however you modified one or more of the same line(s) of the same file(s) on different branches, Git has no way to decide which version should be kept and will thus not be able to complete the merge. It will then ask you to resolve the conflict(s). Conveniently, it will list the file(s) containing the conflict(s).\nThere are fancy tools to resolve conflicts, but you can do it in any text editor: simply open the file(s) listed by Git as having conflicts and look for the following markers:\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nThis is your version.\n=======\nThis is the alternative version of the same section of the file.\n>>>>>>> alternative version\nThese markers are added by Git to signal the areas of conflict. It is up to you to choose between the two versions (or create a third one) and remove the conflict markers. After that, you can stage the file(s) which contained the conflicts to finish the merge (and then you can commit)."

Otherwise patterns match both files and directories.\n/ at the beginning or within a search pattern indicates that the pattern is relative to the directory level of the .gitignore file (usually the root of the project). Otherwise the pattern matches anywhere below the .gitignore level.\n\nExamples:\n/foo/bar/ matches the directory foo/bar, but not the directory a/foo/bar\nfoo/bar/ matches both the directories foo/bar and a/foo/bar\n\n* matches anything except /.\n? matches any one character except /.\nThe range notation (e.g. [a-zA-Z]) can be used to match one of the characters in a range.\nA leading **/ matches all directories.\n\nExample:\n**/foo matches file or directory foo anywhere. This is the same as foo.\n\nA trailing /** matches everything inside what it precedes.\n\nExample:\nabc/** matches all files (recursively) inside directory abc\n\n/**/ matches zero or more directories.\n\nExample:\na/**/b matches a/b, a/x/b, and a/x/y/b"

This means that it is not under version control and it thus doesn’t exist in our repo (since we cloned our repo, we only have the version-controlled files). Let’s create it:\nmkdir data\nNow, let’s create a file in it that contains test:\n\necho \"And another test\" > data/file\n\nWe can rerun our previous two searches to verify that files excluded from version control are not searched:\n\ngit grep -c test\n\nadrian.txt:1\nformerlyadrian.txt:1\nms/protocol.md:1\nms/smabraha.txt:1\nredone17.txt:1\nsrc/test_manuel.py:10\ntestAV1.txt:1\ntext-collab.txt:1\n\n\n\ngit grep -c --untracked test\n\nadrian.txt:1\nformerlyadrian.txt:1\nms/protocol.md:1\nms/smabraha.txt:1\nnewfile:1\nredone17.txt:1\nsrc/test_manuel.py:10\ntestAV1.txt:1\ntext-collab.txt:1\n\n\nAnd now, let’s try:\n\ngit grep -c --untracked --no-exclude-standard test\n\nadrian.txt:1\ndata/file:1\nformerlyadrian.txt:1\nms/protocol.md:1\nms/smabraha.txt:1\nnewfile:1\nredone17.txt:1\nsearch.qmd:41\nsearch.rmarkdown:41\nsrc/test_manuel.py:10\ntestAV1.txt:1\ntext-collab.txt:1\n\n\n\ndata/file, despite being excluded from version control, is also searched.\n\n\n\nSearching all commits\nWe saw that git grep <pattern> <commit> can search a pattern in any commit. Now, what if we all to search all commits for a pattern?\nFor this, we pass the expression $(git rev-list --all) in lieu of <commit>.\ngit rev-list --all creates a list of all the commits in a way that can be used as an argument to other functions.

Depending on your OS you might need to use a different tool.\n\nOf course, you can create a function in your .bashrc file with such code so that you wouldn’t have to type it each time:\ngrep_all_commits () {\n    git grep \"$1\" $(git rev-list --all) |\n        fzf --cycle -i -e |\n        cut -c 1-7 |\n        xclip -r -selection clipboard\n}\nAlternatively, you can pass the result directly into whatever git command you want to use that commit for.\nHere is an example with git show:\ngit grep \"test\" $(git rev-list --all) |\n    fzf --cycle -i -e |\n    cut -c 1-7 |\n    git show\nAnd if you wanted to get really fancy, you could go with:\ngit grep \"test\" $(git rev-list --all) |\n    fzf --cycle -i -e --no-multi \\\n        --ansi --preview=\"$_viewGitLogLine\" \\\n        --header \"enter: view, C-c: copy hash\" \\\n        --bind \"enter:execute:$_viewGitLogLine | less -R\" \\\n        --bind \"ctrl-c:execute:$_gitLogLineToHash |\n        xclip -r -selection clipboard\"\nWrapped in a function:\ngrep_all_commits_preview () {\n    git grep \"$1\" $(git rev-list --all) |\n        fzf --cycle -i -e --no-multi \\\n            --ansi --preview=\"$_viewGitLogLine\" \\\n            --header \"enter: view, C-c: copy hash\" \\\n            --bind \"enter:execute:$_viewGitLogLine |\n              less -R\" \\\n            --bind \"ctrl-c:execute:$_gitLogLineToHash |\n        xclip -r -selection clipboard\"\n}\nThis last function allows you to search through all the results in an incremental fashion while displaying a preview of the selected diff (the changes made at that particular commit). If you want to see more of the diff than the preview displays, press <enter> (then q to quit the pager), if you want to copy the hash of a commit, press C-c (Control + c).\nWith this function, you can now instantly get a preview of the changes made to any line containing an expression for any file, at any commit, and copy the hash of the selected commit. This is really powerful.\n\n\n\nAliases\nIf you don’t want to type a series of flags all the time, you can configure aliases for Git. For instance, Alex Razoumov uses the alias git search for git grep --break --heading -n -i.\nLet’s add to it the -p flag. Here is how you would set this alias:\ngit config --global alias.search 'grep --break --heading -n -i -p'\n\nThis setting gets added to your main Git configuration file (on Linux, by default, at ~/.gitconfig).\n\nFrom there on, you can use your alias with:\n\ngit search test\n\nadrian.txt\n1:Adrian's test text file.\n\nformerlyadrian.txt\n1:Adrian's test text file.\n\nms/protocol.md\n6=using our awesome Rscript.\n9:This is my test.\n\nms/smabraha.txt\n1:This is a test file that I wanted to make, then push it somehow\n\nredone17.txt\n1:this is a test file from redone17\n\nsrc/test_manuel.py\n35=def train(model, device, train_loader, optimizer, epoch):\n50:def test(model, device, test_loader):\n52:    test_loss = 0\n55:        for data, target in test_loader:\n58:            test_loss += F.nll_loss(output, target, reduction='sum').item()  # sum up batch loss\n62:    test_loss /= len(test_loader.dataset)\n64:    print('\\nTest set: Average loss: {:.4f}, Accuracy: {}/{} ({:.0f}%)\\n'.format(\n65:        test_loss, correct, len(test_loader.dataset),\n66:        100. * correct / len(test_loader.dataset)))\n69=def main():\n84:    test_data = datasets.MNIST(\n90:    test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_data, batch_size=100)\n97:        test(model, device, test_loader)\n\ntestAV1.txt\n1:This is a test\n\ntext-collab.txt\n1:This is the collaboration testing"

    "text": "The three trees of Git\n\nWorking directory\nLet’s imagine that you are starting to work on a project.\nFirst, you create a directory.\nIn it, you create several sub-directories.\nIn those, you create a number of files.\nYou can open these files, read them, edit them, etc. This is something you are very familiar with.\nIn the Git world, this is the working directory or working tree of the project.\nThat is: an uncompressed version of your files that you can access and edit.\nYou can think of it as a sandbox because this is where you can experiment with the project. This is where the project gets developed.\nNow, Git has two other important pieces in its architecture.\n\n\nIndex\nIf you want the project history to be useful to future you, it has to be nice and tidy. You don’t want to record snapshots haphazardly or you will never be able to find anything back.\nBefore you record a snapshot, you carefully select the elements of the project as it is now that would be useful to write to the project history together. The index or staging area is what allows to do that: it contains the suggested future snapshot.\n\n\nHEAD\nFinally, the last tree in Git architecture is one snapshot in the project history that serves as a reference version of the project: if you want to see what you have been experimenting on in your “sandbox”, you need to compare the state of the working directory with some snapshot.\nRemember that HEAD is a pointer pointing at a branch, that a branch is itself a pointer pointing at a commit, and finally that a commit is a Git object pointing at a snapshot. When the HEAD pointer moves around, whatever snapshot it points to populates the HEAD tree.\nAs we saw earlier, when you create a commit, HEAD automatically points to the new commit. So the HEAD tree is often filled with the last snapshot you created. But—as we will see later—we can move the HEAD pointer around through other ways. So the HEAD tree can be populated by any snapshot in your project history."

Let’s say that it is now at version v2:\n\n\nThe other two trees remain at version v1.\nIf you run git status, this is what you get:\nOn branch main\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n        modified:   File\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\n\nStaging changes\nYou stage that file (meaning that you will include the changes of that file in the next commit) with:\ngit add File\nAfter which, your Git trees look like this:\n\nNow, the index also has File at version v2 and git status returns:\nOn branch main\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git restore --staged <file>...\" to unstage)\n        modified:   File\n\n\nCommitting changes\nFinally, you create a snapshot and the commit pointing to it—recording the staged changes to history—with:\ngit commit -m \"Added File\"\n-m is a flag that allows to provide the commit message directly in the command line. If you don’t use it, Git will open a text editor so that you can type the message. Without a message, there can be no commit.\nNow your trees look like this:\n\nOur working tree is clean again and git status returns:\nOn branch main\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\nThis means that there are no uncommitted changes in the working tree or the staging area: all the changes have been written to history.\n\nYou don’t have to stage all the changes in the working directory before making a commit; that is actually the whole point of the staging area.\nThis means that the working directory is not necessarily clean after you have created a new commit."

That means that your project will suddenly be back to the state in which it was when you committed that snapshot.\n\nMoving HEAD\nLet’s give this a try and move HEAD to a past commit.\n\nIdentifying the commit we want to move HEAD to\nYou can use the ~ notation:\n\nHEAD~ or HEAD~1 means the commit which precedes the one HEAD is pointing to.\nHEAD~2 means the commit before that.\nHEAD~3 refers to the 3rd commit before the current commit.\netc.\n\nYou can also run git log to find the hash of your commit of interest.\n\n\n\nDetached HEAD\nLet’s look at a hypothetical scenario to see what happens when you checkout a commit.\nThis is our starting point:\n\nNow, we move HEAD to the commit 31fukv1:\ngit checkout 31fukv1\n\nNotice that HEAD is not pointing at a branch anymore: it is pointing directly at a commit. This is called a detached HEAD state and Git will give you plenty of warnings about it.\nIf you look at your files, you will see that they match their state when you committed 31fukv1: your working directory got updated to match the current position of HEAD.\nYou can look at your project at that point in its history, then go back to your main branch (here main) with:\ngit checkout main\n\nAnd that’s that. You took a little trip into the past just to have a look, then came back to “the present” and all went well.\n\n\nCreating commits from a detached HEAD\nNow, when you are at commit 31fukv1, maybe you wanted to try something.\n\nYou can safely try anything you want: when you checkout main to come back to “the present”, those experimental changes will get lost.\nBut what if you want to keep those changes you made at 31fukv1?\nIn that case, as you always do, you create a commit to archive those changes into the project history:\n\nYou can make more commits:\n\nThe thing is that you are still in this detached HEAD state. HEAD is not pointing to a branch as it normally is. Is this a problem?\n\nBad workflow\nWell, it becomes a problem if you checkout main from there:\n\nIf you decide that you don’t care about those commits after all, then all is good. But if you care about them, this is a bad situation because those commits you created when you were in a detached HEAD state are now left behind: they are not in the history of any branch or tag.\nThis is bad for three reasons:\n\nThose commits will not show when you run git log, so it is easy to forget about them.\nIt is not easy to go back to them because there aren’t any tag or branch that you can checkout.\nThe garbage collection (which runs every 30 days by default) will delete those commits which are not on any branch or tag. So you will ultimately loose them.\n\n\n\nGood workflow\nA good workflow would have been to create a new branch on 31fukv1 (let’s call it alternative) and switch to it. That way, the commits created from 31fukv1 are on a branch and they will not be deleted by the next garbage collection:\n\nIn this good workflow, it is totally safe to switch back to main:\n\n\nIf you want to list the commits 23f481q and rthy7wg when you are back on main, you need to run git log with the --all flag.\n\n\n\nRecovering commits left behind\nWhat if you left commits behind (not on a branch)?\nYou can retrieve their hash by running:\ngit reflog\nThis tracks the position of HEAD over time.\nYou can then checkout the commit you care about (so you are going back to a detached HEAD state):\ngit checkout <hash-abandonned-commit>\nThis puts you back into a situation where you can rescue the commit(s) by creating a branch:\nDo this as soon as you can since those commits will be deleted at the next garbage collection (and finding their hash with git reflog will become increasingly complicated as you wait)."

You can edit your latest commit with the --amend flag:\ngit commit --amend\nThis will hide your last commit (as if it had never happened), add the changes in the staging area (if any) to the changes in that last commit, open a text editor showing the message of the last commit (you can keep or edit that message), and create a new commit which replaces your last commit.\nSo if you only want to change the commit message, run that command with an empty staging area. If you want to add changes to the last commit, stage them, then run the command.\nIn short, what this does is to replace your last commit with a new commit with the added changes and/or edited message. This prevents having a messy history with commits of the type “add missing file to last commit” or “better message for last commit: bla bla bla”. If you made a typo in your last commit message (and if you care about having a nice, clean history), you can fix it easily this way.\n\n\nYour turn:\n\n\nRun git log --oneline (notice the hash of the last commit)\nEdit your last commit message\nRun git log --oneline again to see that your last commit now has a new hash (so it is a different commit) and a new message\nNow, make some change in your project (add a file, or edit a file… any change you want)\nThen add that new change to your last commit without changing the message"

The function fetch waits for a Future to complete and returns the result of the computation.\n\nExample:\n\nThe function myid gives the id of the current process. As I mentioned earlier, the process running the interactive Julia prompt has the pid 1. So myid() normally returns 1.\nBut we can “spawn” myid on one of the worker, for instance the first worker (so pid 2):\n@spawnat 2 myid()\nAs you can see, we get a Future as a result. But if we pass it through fetch, we get the result of myid ran on the worker with pid 2:\nfetch(@spawnat 2 myid())\nIf you want tasks to be assigned to any worker automatically, you can pass the symbol :any to @spawnat instead of the worker id:\n@spawnat :any myid()\nTo get the result:\nfetch(@spawnat :any myid())\nIf you run this multiple times, you will see that myid is run on any of your available workers. This will however never return 1, except when you only have one running Julia process (in that case, the process running the prompt is considered a worker)."

    "text": "Why would I want to learn a new language? I already know R/python.\n\nR and python are interpreted languages: the code is executed directly, without prior-compilation. This is extremely convenient: it is what allows you to run code in an interactive shell. The price to pay is low performance: R and python are simply not good at handling large amounts of data. To overcome this limitation, users often turn to C or C++ for the most computation-intensive parts of their analyses. These are compiled—and extremely efficient—languages, but the need to use multiple languages and the non-interactive nature of compiled languages make this approach tedious.\nJulia uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation: the code is compiled at run time. This combines the interactive advantage of interpreted languages with the efficiency of compiled ones. Basically, it feels like running R or python, while it is almost as fast as C. This makes Julia particularly well suited for big data analyses, machine learning, or heavy modelling.\nIn addition, multiple dispatch (generic functions with multiple methods depending on the types of all the arguments) is at the very core of Julia. This is extremly convenient, cutting on conditionals and repetitions, and allowing for easy extensibility without having to rewrite code.\nFinally, Julia shines by its extremely clean and concise syntax. This last feature makes it easy to learn and really enjoyable to use.\nIn this workshop, which does not require any prior experience in Julia (experience in another language—e.g. R or python—would be best), we will go over the basics of Julia’s syntax and package system; then we will push the performance aspect further by looking at how Julia can make use of clusters for large scale parallel computing."

    "section": "Introducing Julia",
    "text": "Introducing Julia\n\nBrief history\nStarted in 2009 by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman, the general-purpose programming language Julia was launched in 2012 as free and open source software. Version 1.0 was released in 2018.\nRust developer Graydon Hoare wrote an interesting post which places Julia in a historical context of programming languages.\n\n\nWhy another language?\n\nJIT\nComputer languages mostly fall into two categories: compiled languages and interpreted languages.\n\nCompiled languages\nCompiled languages require two steps:\n\nin a first step the code you write in a human-readable format (the source code, usually in plain text) gets compiled into machine code\nit is then this machine code that is used to process your data\n\nSo you write a script, compile it, then use it.\n\nBecause machine code is a lot easier to process by computers, compiled languages are fast. The two step process however makes prototyping new code less practical, these languages are hard to learn, and debugging compilation errors can be challenging.\n\nExamples of compiled languages include C, C++, Fortran, Go, and Haskell.\n\n\n\nInterpreted languages\nInterpreted languages are executed directly which has many advantages such as dynamic typing and direct feed-back from the code and they are easy to learn, but this comes at the cost of efficiency. The source code can facultatively be bytecompiled into non human-readable, more compact, lower level bytecode which is read by the interpreter more efficiently.\n\n\nExamples of interpreted languages include R, Python, Perl, and JavaScript.\n\n\n\nA common workflow\nSo, with this, what do researchers do?\nA common workflow, with the constraints of either type of languages, consists of:\n\nexploring the data and developing code using a sample of the data or reasonably light computations in an interpreted language,\ntranslating the code into a compiled language,\nfinally throwing the full data and all the heavy duty computation at that optimized code.\n\nThis works and it works well.\nBut, as you can imagine, this roundabout approach is tedious, not to mention the fact that it involves mastering 2 languages.\n\n\nJIT compiled languages\nJulia uses just-in-time compilation or JIT based on LLVM: the source code is compiled at run time. This combines the flexibility of interpretation with the speed of compilation, bringing speed to an interactive language. It also allows for dynamic recompilation, continuous weighing of gains and costs of the compilation of parts of the code, and other on the fly optimizations.\nOf course, there are costs here too. They come in the form of overhead time to compile code the first time it is run and increased memory usage.\n\n\n\nMultiple dispatch\nIn languages with multiple dispatch, functions apply different methods at run time based on the type of the operands. This brings great type stability and improves speed.\nJulia is extremely flexible: type declaration is not required. Out of convenience, you can forego the feature if you want. Specifying types however will greatly optimize your code.\nHere is a good post on type stability, multiple dispatch, and Julia efficiency."

    "text": "Points worth considering\nThere are a several points you might want to consider in making that choice. For instance, what tools do people use in your field? (what tools are used in the papers you read?) What tools are your colleagues and collaborators using?\nLooking a bit further into the future, whether you are considering staying in academia or working in industry could also influence your choice. If the former, paying attention to the literature is key, if the latter, it may be good to have a look at the trends in job postings.\nSome frameworks offer collections of already-made toolkits. They are thus easy to start using and do not require a lot of programming experience. On the other hand, they may feel like black boxes and they are not very customizable. Scikit-learn and Keras—usually run on top of TensorFlow—fall in that category. Lower level tools allow you full control and tuning of your models, but can come with a steeper learning curve.\nPyTorch, developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab, has seen a huge increase in popularity in research in recent years due to its highly pythonic syntax, very convenient tensors, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, dynamic computation graphs, and because it is free and open-source.\nSeveral libraries are now adding a higher level on top of PyTorch: fastai, which we will use in this course, PyTorch Lightning, and PyTorch Ignite. fastai, in addition to the convenience of being able to write a model in a few lines of code, allows to dive as low as you choose into the PyTorch code, thus making it unconstrained by the optional ease of use. It also adds countless functionality. The downside of using this added layer is that it can make it less straightforward to install on a machine or to tweak and customize.\nThe most popular machine learning library currently remains TensorFlow, developed by the Google Brain Team. While it has a Python API, its syntax can be more obscure.\nJulia’s syntax is well suited for the implementation of mathematical models, GPU kernels can be written directly in Julia, and Julia’s speed is attractive in computation hungry fields. So Julia has also seen the development of many ML packages such as Flux or Knet. The user base of Julia remains quite small however.\nMy main motivation in writing this section however is to raise awareness about one question that should really be considered: whether the tool you decide to learn and use in your research is open-source or proprietary."

    "section": "Proprietary tools: a word of caution",
    "text": "Proprietary tools: a word of caution\nAs a student, it is tempting to have the following perspective:\n\nMy university pays for this very expensive license. I have free access to this very expensive tool. It would be foolish not to make use of it while I can!\n\nWhen there are no equivalent or better open-source tools, that might be true. But when superior open-source tools exist, these university licenses are more of a trap than a gift.\nHere are some of the reasons you should be wary of proprietary tools:\n\nResearchers who do not have access to the tool cannot reproduce your methods\nLarge Canadian universities may offer a license for the tool, but grad students in other countries, independent researchers, researchers in small organizations, etc. may not have access to a free license (or tens of thousands of dollars to pay for it).\n\n\nOnce you graduate, you may not have access to the tool anymore\nOnce you leave your Canadian institution, you may become one of those researchers who do not have access to that tool. This means that you will not be able to re-run your thesis analyses, re-use your methods, and apply the skills you learnt. The time you spent learning that expensive tool you could play with for free may feel a lot less like a gift then.\n\n\nYour university may stop paying for a license\nAs commercial tools fall behind successful open-source ones, some universities may decide to stop purchasing a license. It happened during my years at SFU with an expensive and clunky citation manager which, after having been promoted for years by the library through countless workshops, got abandoned in favour of a much better free and open-source one.\n\n\nYou may get locked-in\nProprietary tools often come with proprietary formats and, depending on the tool, it may be painful (or impossible) to convert your work to another format. When that happens, you are locked-in.\n\n\nProprietary tools are often black boxes\nIt is often impossible to see the source code of proprietary software.\n\n\nLong-term access\nIt is often very difficult to have access to old versions of proprietary tools (and this can be necessary to reproduce old studies). When companies disappear, the tools they produced usually disappear with them. open-source tools, particularly those who have their code under version control in repositories such as GitHub, remain fully accessible (including all stages of development), and if they get abandoned, their maintenance can be taken over or restarted by others.\n\n\nThe licenses you have access to may be limiting and a cause of headache\nFor instance, the Alliance does not have an unlimited number of MATLAB licenses. Since these licenses come with complex rules (one license needed for each node, additional licenses for each toolbox, additional licenses for newer tools, etc.), it can quickly become a nightmare to navigate through it all. You may want to have a look at some of the comments in this thread.\n\n\nProprietary tools fall behind popular open-source tools\nEven large teams of software engineers cannot compete against an active community of researchers developing open-source tools. When open-source tools become really popular, the number of users contributing to their development vastly outnumbers what any company can provide. The testing, licensing, and production of proprietary tools are also too slow to keep up with quickly evolving fields of research. (Of course, open-source tools which do not take off and remain absolutely obscure do not see the benefit of a vast community.)\n\n\nProprietary tools often fail to address specialized edge cases needed in research\nIt is not commercially sound to develop cutting edge capabilities so specialized in a narrow subfield that they can only target a minuscule number of customers. But this is often what research needs. With open-source tools, researchers can develop the capabilities that fit their very specific needs. So while commercial tools are good and reliable for large audiences, they are often not the best in research. This explains the success of R over tools such as SASS or Stata in the past decade."

of?\n\nprint(type(train_data[0][0]))\nprint(type(train_data[0][1]))\n\n<class 'torch.Tensor'>\n<class 'int'>\n\n\nIt is made of the tensor for the first image (remember that we transformed the images into tensors when we created the objects train_data and test_data) and the integer of the first label (which you can see is 5 when you print train_data[0][1]).\nSo since train_data[0][0] is the tensor representing the image of the first pair, let’s check its size:\n\nprint(train_data[0][0].size())\n\ntorch.Size([1, 28, 28])\n\n\nThat makes sense: a color image would have 3 layers of RGB values (so the size in the first dimension would be 3), but because the MNIST has black and white images, there is a single layer of values—the values of each pixel on a gray scale—so the first dimension has a size of 1. The 2nd and 3rd dimensions correspond to the width and length of the image in pixels, hence 28 and 28.\n\n\nYour turn:\n\nRun the following:\nprint(train_data[0][0][0])\nprint(train_data[0][0][0][0])\nprint(train_data[0][0][0][0][0])\nAnd think about what each of them represents.\nThen explore the test_data object.\n\n\n\nPlotting an image from the data\nFor this, we will use pyplot from matplotlib.\nFirst, we select the image of the first pair and we resize it from 3 to 2 dimensions by removing its dimension of size 1 with torch.squeeze:\nimg = torch.squeeze(train_data[0][0])\nThen, we plot it with pyplot, but since we are in a cluster, instead of showing it to screen with plt.show(), we save it to file:\nplt.imshow(img, cmap='gray')\nThis is what that first image looks like:\n\nAnd indeed, it matches the first label we explored earlier (train_data[0][1]).\n\n\nPlotting an image with its pixel values\nWe can plot it with more details by showing the value of each pixel in the image. One little twist is that we need to pick a threshold value below which we print the pixel values in white otherwise they would not be visible (black on near black background). We also round the pixel values to one decimal digit so as not to clutter the result.\nimgplot = plt.figure(figsize = (12, 12))\nsub = imgplot.add_subplot(111)\nsub.imshow(img, cmap='gray')\nwidth, height = img.shape\nthresh = img.max() / 2.5\nfor x in range(width):\n    for y in range(height):\n        val = round(img[x][y].item(), 1)\n        sub.annotate(str(val), xy=(y, x),\n                     horizontalalignment='center',\n                     verticalalignment='center',\n                     color='white' if img[x][y].item() < thresh else 'black')"

If you want to play for 8 hours in Jupyter, you are requesting an 8 hour job. Now, most of the time you spend on Jupyter is spent typing, running bits and pieces of code, or doing nothing at all. If you ask for GPUs, many CPUs, and lots of RAM, all of it will remain idle almost all of the time. It is a really suboptimal use of the Alliance resources.\nIn addition, if you ask for lots of resources for a long time, you will have to wait a long time in the queue before they get allocated to you.\nLastly, you will go through your allocation quickly.\nA much better strategy is to develop and test your code (with very little data, few epochs, etc.) in an interactive job (with salloc) or in Jupyter, then, launch an sbatch job to actually train your model. This ensures that heavy duty resources such as GPU(s) are only allocated to you when you are actually needing and using them.\n\nConcrete example with our training cluster: this cluster only has 1 GPU. If you want to use it in Jupyter, you have to request it for your Jupyter session. This means that the entire time your Jupyter session is active, nobody else can use that GPU. While you let your session idle or do tasks that do not require a GPU, this is not a good use of resources."

    "text": "Artificial neural networks\nArtificial neural networks (ANN) are one of the machine learning models (other models include decision trees or Bayesian networks). Their potential and popularity has truly exploded in recent years and this is what we will focus on in this course.\nArtificial neural networks are a series of layered units mimicking the concept of biological neurons: inputs are received by every unit of a layer, computed, then transmitted to units of the next layer. In the process of learning, experience strengthens some connections between units and weakens others.\nIn biological networks, the information consists of action potentials (neuron membrane rapid depolarizations) propagating through the network. In artificial ones, the information consists of tensors (multidimensional arrays) of weights and biases: each unit passes a weighted sum of an input tensor with an additional—possibly weighted—bias through an activation function before passing on the output tensor to the next layer of units.\n\n\nThe bias allows to shift the output of the activation function to the right or to the left (i.e. it creates an offset).\n\nSchematic of a biological neuron:\n\n\nFrom Dhp1080, Wikipedia\n\nSchematic of an artificial neuron:\n\n\nModified from O.C. Akgun & J. Mei 2019\n\nWhile biological neurons are connected in extremely intricate patterns, artificial ones follow a layered structure. Another difference in complexity is in the number of units: the human brain has 65–90 billion neurons. ANN have much fewer units.\nNeurons in mouse cortex:\n\n\nNeurons are in green, the dark branches are blood vessels. Image by Na Ji, UC Berkeley\n\nNeural network with 2 hidden layers:\n\n\nFrom The Maverick Meerkat\n\nThe information in biological neurons is an all-or-nothing electrochemical pulse or action potential. Greater stimuli don’t produce stronger signals but increase firing frequency. In contrast, artificial neurons pass the computation of their inputs through an activation function and the output can take any of the values possible with that function.\nThreshold potential in biological neurons:\n\n\nModified from Blacktc, Wikimedia\n\nSome of the most common activation functions in artificial neurons:\n\n\nFrom Diganta Misra 2019\n\nWhich activation function to use depends on the type of problem and the available computing budget. Some early functions have fallen out of use while new ones have emerged (e.g. sigmoid got replaced by ReLU which is easier to train).\n\nLearning\nThe process of learning in biological NN happens through neuron death or growth and through the creation or loss of synaptic connections between neurons. In ANN, learning happens through optimization algorithms such as gradient descent which minimize cross entropy loss functions by adjusting the weights and biases connecting each layer of neurons over many iterations (cross entropy is the difference between the predicted and the real distributions).\n\n\nFrom xkcd.com\n\n\n\nGradient descent\nThere are several gradient descent methods:\nBatch gradient descent uses all examples in each iteration and is thus slow for large datasets (the parameters are adjusted only after all the samples have been processed).\nMini-batch gradient descent is an intermediate approach: it uses mini-batch sized examples in each iteration. This allows a vectorized approach (and hence parallelization).\nThe Adam optimization algorithm is a popular variation of mini-batch gradient descent.\nStochastic gradient descent uses one example in each iteration. It is thus much faster than batch gradient descent (the parameters are adjusted after each example). But it does not allow any vectorization.\n\n\nFrom Imad Dabbura\n\n\n\n3Blue1Brown by Grant Sanderson videos\n3Blue1Brown by Grant Sanderson has a series of 4 videos on neural networks which is easy to watch, fun, and does an excellent job at introducing the functioning of a simple neural network.\n\nWhat are NN?

(21 min)\n\n\n\nWhat is backpropagation? (14 min)\n\n\nThere is one minor terminological error in this video: they call the use of mini-batches stochastic gradient descent. In fact, this is called mini-batch gradient descent. Stochastic gradient descent uses a single example at each iteration.\n\n\n\nHow does backpropagation work? (10 min)\n\n\n\n\nTypes of ANN\n\nFully connected neural networks\n\n\nFrom Glosser.ca, Wikipedia\n\nEach neuron receives inputs from every neuron of the previous layer and passes its output to every neuron of the next layer.\n\n\nConvolutional neural networks\n\n\nFrom Programming Journeys by Rensu Theart\n\nConvolutional neural networks (CNN) are used for spatially structured data (e.g. in image recognition).\nImages have huge input sizes and would require a very large number of neurons in a fully connected neural net. In convolutional layers, neurons receive input from a subarea (called local receptive field) of the previous layer. This greatly reduces the number of parameters.\nOptionally, pooling (combining the outputs of neurons in a subarea) reduces the data dimensions. The stride then dictates how the subarea is moved across the image. Max-pooling is one of the forms of pooling which uses the maximum for each subarea.\n\n\nRecurrent neural networks\n\n\nFrom fdeloche, Wikipedia\n\nRecurrent neural networks (RNN) such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are used for chain structured data (e.g. in speech recognition).\nThey are not feedforward networks (i.e. networks for which the information moves only in the forward direction without any loop).\n\n\nTransformers\nA combination of two RNNs or sets of RNNs (the encoder and the decoder) is used in sequence to sequence models for translation or picture captioning. Such models were slow to process a lot of data.\nIn 2014 and 2015, the concept of attention (giving added weight to important words) was developed, greatly improving the ability of such models to process a lot of data.\nThis blog post by Jay Alammar—a blogger whose high-quality posts have been referenced in MIT and Stanford courses—explains this in a high-level visual fashion.\nThe problem with recurrence is that it is not easily to parallelize (and thus to run fast on GPUs).\nIn 2017, a new model—the transformer—was proposed: by using only attention mechanisms and no recurrence, the transformer achieves better results in an easily parallelizable fashion.\nJay Alammar has also a blog post on the transformer. The post includes a 30 min video.\nWith the addition of transfer learning, powerful transformers emerged in the field of NLP (Natural Language Processing). Examples include BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) from Google and GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3) from OpenAI.\nJay Alammar has yet another great blog post on these advanced NLP models.\n\n\n\nDeep learning\nThe first layer of a neural net is the input layer. The last one is the output layer. All the layers in-between are called hidden layers. Shallow neural networks have only one hidden layer and deep networks have two or more hidden layers. When an ANN is deep, we talk about Deep Learning (DL).\n\n\nFrom xkcd.com"

The most suited structure is multidimensional (to hold several layers of information) and since all data is of the same type, it is an array.\nPython already has several multidimensional array structures—the most popular of which being NumPy’s ndarray—but the particularities of deep learning call for special characteristics: ability to run operations on GPUs and/or in a distributed fashion, as well as the ability to keep track of computation graphs for automatic differentiation.\nThe PyTorch tensor is a Python data structure with these characteristics that can also easily be converted to/from NumPy’s ndarray and integrates well with other Python libraries such as Pandas.\nIn this webinar, suitable for users of all levels, we will have a deep look at this data structure and go much beyond a basic introduction.\nIn particular, we will:\n\nsee how tensors are stored in memory,\nlook at the metadata which allows this efficient memory storage,\ncover the basics of working with tensors (indexing, vectorized operations…),\nmove tensors to/from GPUs,\nconvert tensors to/from NumPy ndarrays,\nsee how tensors work in distributed frameworks,\nsee how linear algebra can be done with PyTorch tensors.\n\n\nSlides (click and wait: my reveal.js presentations are heavy and take some time to load…)"

This makes vectors different from one-dimensional arrays which have a dim of 1.\nYou might have noticed that 2 is a double (double precision floating point number, equivalent of “float” in other languages). In R, this is the default, even if you don’t type 2.0. This prevents the kind of weirdness you can find in, for instance, Python.\nIn Python:\n>>> 2 == 2.0\nTrue\n>>> type(2) == type(2.0)\nFalse\n>>> type(2)\n<class 'int'>\n>>> type(2.0)\n<class 'float'>\nIn R:\n> 2 == 2.0\n[1] TRUE\n> typeof(2) == typeof(2.0)\n[1] TRUE\n> typeof(2)\n[1] \"double\"\n> typeof(2.0)\n[1] \"double\"\nIf you want to define an integer variable, you use:\n\nb <- 2L\nb\n\n[1] 2\n\ntypeof(b)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\nmode(b)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nstr(b)\n\n int 2\n\n\nThere are six vector types:\n\nlogical\ninteger\ndouble\ncharacter\ncomplex\nraw\n\n\n\nWith multiple elements\n\nc <- c(2, 4, 1)\nc\n\n[1] 2 4 1\n\ntypeof(c)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\nmode(c)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nstr(c)\n\n num [1:3] 2 4 1\n\n\n\nd <- c(TRUE, TRUE, NA, FALSE)\nd\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE    NA FALSE\n\ntypeof(d)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\nstr(d)\n\n logi [1:4] TRUE TRUE NA FALSE\n\n\nNA (“Not Available”) is a logical constant of length one.

While the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) has an amazing map in terms of spacial coverage, it doesn’t yet have much temporal data.\nTo look at glacier retreat, we will look at the USGS time series of the named glaciers of Glacier National Park3. These 4 datasets have the contour lines of 39 glaciers for the years 1966, 1998, 2005, and 2015.3 Fagre, D.B., McKeon, L.A., Dick, K.A., and Fountain, A.G., 2017, Glacier margin time series (1966, 1998, 2005, 2015) of the named glaciers of Glacier National Park, MT, USA: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/F7P26WB1.\nWe could load and clean these datasets one by one. Copying and pasting code however is inefficient and error-prone. A better approach is to do this in a functional programming framework: create a function which does all the data loading and cleaning, then pass each element of a vector of the paths of all 4 datasets to it using purrr::map().\n“Cleaning” here consists of selecting the variables we are interested in, putting them in the same order in each dataset (they were not initially) and giving the exact same name across all datasets (there were case inconsistencies between datasets and R is case sensitive).\n# create a function that reads and cleans the data\nprep <- function(dir) {\n  g <- st_read(dir)\n  g %<>% rename_with(~ tolower(gsub(\"Area....\", \"area\", .x)))\n  g %<>% select(\n    year,\n    objectid,\n    glacname,\n    area,\n    shape_leng,\n    x_coord,\n    y_coord,\n    source_sca,\n    source\n  )\n}\n\n# create a vector of dataset names\ndirs <- grep(\"GNPglaciers_.*\", list.dirs(), value = T)\n\n# pass each element of that vector through prep() thanks to map()\ngnp <- map(dirs, prep)\nmap() returns a list, so we now have a list (gnp) of 4 elements: the 4 sf objects containing our cleaned datasets. A list is not really convenient and we will turn it into a single sf object.\nBefore doing so however, we want to make sure that they all have the same CRS:\nst_crs(gnp[[1]]) == st_crs(gnp[[2]])\nst_crs(gnp[[1]]) == st_crs(gnp[[3]])\nst_crs(gnp[[1]]) == st_crs(gnp[[4]])\nThey do, so we can turn gnp into a single sf object:\ngnp <- do.call(\"rbind\", gnp)\n\ngnp\nstr(gnp)\nWe can now map the data:\ntm_shape(gnp) +\n  tm_polygons(\"year\", palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_layout(\n    title = \"Glaciers of Glacier National Park\",\n    title.position = c(\"center\", \"top\"),\n    legend.title.color = \"#fcfcfc\",\n    legend.text.size = 1,\n    bg.color = \"#fcfcfc\",\n    inner.margins = c(0.07, 0.03, 0.07, 0.03),\n    outer.margins = 0\n  ) +\n  tm_compass(\n    type = \"arrow\",\n    position = c(\"right\", \"top\"),\n    text.size = 0.7\n  ) +\n  tm_scale_bar(\n    breaks = c(0, 10, 20),\n    position = c(\"right\", \"BOTTOM\"),\n    text.size = 1\n  )\n\nI didn’t want to show the legend title and because there is no option to remove it, I set its color to that of the background."

    "text": "Markup and Markdown\n\nMarkup languages\nMarkup languages control the formatting of text documents. They are powerful but complex and the raw text (before it is rendered into its formatted version) is visually cluttered and hard to read.\nExamples of markup languages include LaTeX and HTML.\n\nTex (often with the macro package LaTeX) is used to create pdf.\n\n\nExample LaTeX:\n\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\title{My title}\n\\author{My name}\n\\usepackage{datetime}\n\\newdate{date}{24}{11}{2022}\n\\date{\\displaydate{date}}\n\\begin{document}\n \\maketitle\n \\section{First section}\n Some text in the first section.\n\\end{document}\n\nHTML (often with css or scss files to customize the format) is used to create webpages.\n\n\nExample HTML:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\" />\n    <title>My title</title>\n    <address class=\"author\">My name</address>\n    <input type=\"date\" value=\"2022-11-24\" />\n  </head>\n  <h1>First section</h1>\n  <body>\n    Some text in the first section.\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nMarkdown\nA number of minimalist markup languages intend to remove all the visual clutter and complexity to create raw texts that are readable prior to rendering. Markdown (note the pun with “markup”), created in 2004, is the most popular of them. Due to its simplicity, it has become quasi-ubiquitous. Many implementations exist which add a varying number of features (as you can imagine, a very simple markup language is also fairly limited).\nMarkdown files are simply text files and they use the .md extension.\n\n\nBasic Markdown syntax\nIn its basic form, Markdown is mostly used to create webpages. Conveniently, raw HTML can be included whenever the limited markdown syntax isn’t sufficient.\nHere is an overview of the Markdown syntax supported by many applications.\n\n\nPandoc and its extended Markdown syntax\nWhile the basic syntax is good enough for HTML outputs, it is very limited for other formats.\nPandoc is a free and open-source markup format converter. Pandoc supports an extended Markdown syntax with functionality for figures, tables, callout blocks, LaTeX mathematical equations, citations, and YAML metadata blocks. In short, everything needed for the creation of scientific documents.\nSuch documents remain as readable as basic Markdown documents (thus respecting the Markdown philosophy), but they can now be rendered in sophisticated pdf, books, entire websites, Word documents, etc.\nAnd of course, as such documents remain text files, you can put them under version control with Git.\n\nPrevious example using Pandoc’s Markdown:\n\n---\ntitle: My title\nauthor: My name\ndate: 2022-11-24\n---\n# First section\nSome text in the first section."

For this, launch R and run:\n\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\nIf you want to use it with Python, you will need:\n\nPython 3 (download here if don’t have it on your system),\nJupyterLab. For this, open a terminal and run:\n\npython3 -m pip install jupyterlab  # if you are on MacOS or Linux\npy -m pip install jupyterlab       # if you are on Windows\nFinally, if you want to use Quarto with Julia, you will need:\n\nJulia (download here if you don’t have Julia),\nthe IJulia and Revise packages.
