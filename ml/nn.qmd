[3Blue1Brown by Grant Sanderson](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) has a series of 4 videos on neural networks which is easy to watch, fun, and does an excellent job at introducing the functioning of a simple neural network.

As you develop your own ML models, if you find that your mathematical background is shaky, 3blue1brown also has [an excellent series of videos on linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) and [an equally great one on calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr).

There is one minor terminological error in this video: they call the use of mini-batches *stochastic gradient descent*. In fact, this is called *mini-batch gradient descent*. Stochastic gradient descent uses a single example at each iteration.
