Super-resolution—the process of (re)creating high resolution images from low resolution ones—is an old field, but deep neural networks have seen a sudden surge of new and very impressive methods over the past 10 years, from SRCCN to SRGAN to Transformers.

In this webinar, I will give a quick overview of these methods and show how the latest state-of-the-art model—[SwinIR](https://github.com/jingyunliang/swinir)—performs on a few test images. We will use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as our framework.
