title: JAX vs NumPy

[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is a popular Python scientific API at the core of a lot of libraries. It is fast, written in Python and C, and provides the `ndarray` data type.

JAX uses a similar API with additional constraints.

Being familiar with NumPy is thus an advantage to get started with JAX. [The NumPy quickstart](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html) is a good resource to get started with NumPy.

```{python}
import numpy as np  # for comparison

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
```

different Python types

```{python}
x = np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
print(x)
type(x)
```

```{python}
y = jnp.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
print(y)
type(y)
```

JAX arrays are immutable

```{python}
x[0, 0] = 9
print(x)
```

```{python}
y[0, 0] = 9
print(y)
```

```{python}
y = y.at[0, 0].set(10)
print(y)
```
