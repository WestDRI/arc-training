:::{.def}

[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is a popular Python scientific API at the core of many libraries. JAX uses a NumPy-inspired API. There are however important differences that we will explore in this section.

:::

## Comparison with NumPy

### jax.numpy

NumPy being so popular, JAX comes with a convenient high-level wrapper to NumPy: `jax.numpy`.

:::{.note}

Being familiar with NumPy is an advantage to get started with JAX. [The NumPy quickstart](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html) is a useful resource.

:::

However,

- there are key differences with NumPy,
- for a more efficient usage, JAX also comes with a lower-level API: `jax.lax`.

### Pseudorandom number generation (PRNG)



```{.python}
import numpy as np  # for comparison

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
```

### Different default data types

```{.python}
x = np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
print(x)
type(x)
```

```{.python}
y = jnp.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
print(y)
type(y)
```

### Immutable arrays

```{.python}
x[0, 0] = 9
print(x)
```

```{.python}
y[0, 0] = 9
print(y)
```

```{.python}
y = y.at[0, 0].set(10)
print(y)
```

## Integration with NumPy
