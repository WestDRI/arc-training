Two great open-source tools to work with Git in a nice visual manner while remaining in the command line.

:::

## lazygit

[lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is an excellent multi-platform [terminal user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) for Git. It is my favourite Git interface and I use it all the time. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

I recently gave a webinar on it that you can find [here](wb_lazygit.qmd). Below is the video from the webinar:

## fzf

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is a fantastic multi-platform command line fuzzy finder with a huge versatility.

In this video, I demo quickly how it can be used with Git:

fzf is [easy to install on your machine](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) and can also be installed on the Alliance clusters with:

```{.bash}
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf &&
    ~/.fzf/install

# then answer y, y, n to the 3 questions
```
