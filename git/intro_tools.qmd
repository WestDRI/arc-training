:::{.def}

Two great open-source tools to work with Git in a nice visual manner while remaining in the command line.

## fzf

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is a fantastic multi-platform command line fuzzy finder with a huge versatility.

:::{.example}

In this video, I demo quickly how it can be used with Git:

fzf is [easy to install on your machine](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) and can also be installed on the Alliance clusters with:

```{.bash}
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf &&
    ~/.fzf/install

# then answer y, y, n to the 3 questions
```

## lazygit

[lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is an excellent multi-platform user interface for Git which works in the command line. It is actually my favourite tool and I use it all the time. I will demo how I use it on my computer.

Unfortunately, it is very difficult to install on the Alliance clusters [(but easy to install on your machine)](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
