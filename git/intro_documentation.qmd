:::{.def}

Git comes with internal documentation. This section covers how to access it.

:::

## Manual pages

The manual page for any Git command can be open with:

```{.bash}
git help <command>
```

:::{.example}

Example:

:::

```{.bash}
git help commit
```

On Unix systems (Linux and macOS), you can alternatively use the `man` command this way:

```{.bash}
man git-<command>
```

:::{.example}

Example:

:::

```{.bash}
man git-commit
```

Finally, many commands come with an `help` flag:

```{.bash}
git <command> --help
```

:::{.example}

Example:

:::

```{.bash}
git commit --help
```

All these methods lead to the same thing: the manual page corresponding to the command will open in a pager (usually [less](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_(Unix))). A pager is a program which makes it easier to read documents in the command line.

:::{.info}

**Useful keybindings when you are in the pager:**

```{.bash}
SPACE      scroll one screen down
b          backa one screen
q          quit the pager
g		   go to the top of the document
7g		   go to line 7 from the top
G		   go to the bottom of the document
/		   search for a term
		   n will take you to the next result
		   N to the previous result
```

:::

## Command options

Instead of opening the full manual in the pager, if you want to simply output the various flags (options) for a command directly in the terminal, you can use:

```{.bash}
git <command> -h
```

:::{.example}

Example:

:::

```{.bash}
git commit -h
```
