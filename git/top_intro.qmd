This introductory course to Git will allow you to put your projects under version control, create commits with important versions of your files, revisit these versions, and add remotes on services such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).

You will get a deep understanding of the functioning of Git and learn to use it from the command line.
