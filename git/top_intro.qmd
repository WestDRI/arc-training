A version control system allows you to track changes to your text files and save important versions of your projects that you can revisit or revert to later. It is a critical aspect to any serious workflow while prototyping code, building a website, developing software, or writing documents such as a thesis or papers in markdown or LaTeX.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/)—a free and open source software—has become the standard tool for version control.

In this hands-on course, you will learn how Git works and how to get started putting your projects under version control.
