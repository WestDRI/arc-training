## Abstract

:::{.def}

What is the point of creating all these commits if you are unable to make use of them because you can't find the information you need in them?

In this workshop, we will learn how to search your files at any of their versions and search your commits logs.

By the end of the workshop, you should be able to retrieve anything you need from your versioned history.

**Prerequisites:** \
This special Git topic is suitable for people who already use Git. You don't need to be an expert, but you will need to bring a project under version control with several commits. We expect that you are able to run basic Git commands in the command line.
