Git is excellent at merging different versions of projects. Furthermore, it is a [distributed version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control), meaning that everybody has a full copy of the project locally and local copies exchange information via a shared remote (examples of remotes that allow for easy shared access include servers and Internet hosting services such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)).

These characteristics make Git a powerful collaboration tool: everybody can work simultaneously on their local copies—a huge benefit over having to work asynchronously on a unique copy sent back and forth!

There are various ways to collaborate on a project using Git and a shared remote:

- You initiate a project and want others to contribute to it *(situation 1)*, or
- You want to contribute to a project started by someone else and
	- You have write access to it *(situation 2)*, or
    - You do not have write access to it *(situation 3)*.

This course will cover all three cases using GitHub as an example.

*This course assumes working knowledge of Git. If you are new to it, you should first look at [our introductory course](top_intro).*
