Git is very good at merging different versions of projects. For this reason, it is a powerful collaboration tool: collaborators can work simultaneously on projects without having to send it back and forth and working asynchronously.

Having  when all contributors to a project have access to a common remote.

Examples of remotes that allow for such common access include servers or Internet hosting services such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

Collaborations fall into one of three possible situations:

- You initiate a project and want others to contribute to it *(situation 1)*, or
- You want to contribute to a project started by someone else and
	- You have write access to it *(situation 2)*, or
    - You do not have write access to it *(situation 3)*.

This course will cover all three cases using GitHub as an example.

*This course assumes working knowledge of Git. If you are new to it, you should first look at [our introductory course](top_intro).*
