Packages are a set of functions, constants, and/or data developed by the community that add functionality to R.

In this section, we look at where to find packages and how to install them.

:::

## Looking for packages

- [Package finder](https://rdrr.io/find/?repos=cran%2Cbioc%2Crforge%2Cgithub&fuzzy_slug=)
- Your peers and the literature

## Package documentation

- [List of CRAN packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html)
- [Package documentation](https://rdrr.io/)

## Managing R packages

R packages can be installed, updated, and removed from within R:

```{.r}
install.packages("package-name")
remove.packages("package-name")
update_packages()
```

## Loading packages

To make a package available in an R session, you load it with the `library()` function.

:::{.example}

Example:

:::

```{.r}
library(readxl)
```

Alternatively, you can access a function from a package without loading it with the syntax: `package::function()`.

:::{.example}

Example:

:::

```{.r}
readxl::read_excel("file.xlsx")
```
