## Base R: `parallel` package

The `parallel` package has been part of the `base` package group since R version 2.14.0. \
This means that it is comes with R, however it needs to be loaded in a session before its content can be accessed:

```{.r}
library(parallel)
```

Most parallel approaches in R build on this package.

All other packages mentioned in this lesson are external packages and need to be installed with `install.packages()`.

## `parallelly` package

The [`parallelly`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/parallelly/index.html) package—part of the [futureverse](https://www.futureverse.org/) suite of packages developed by [Henrik Bengtsson](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/henrik.bengtsson)—adds functionality to the `parallel` package.
