You might have heard of [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/): a way to intertwine code and prose in a single scientific document. [The company behind R Markdown](https://posit.co/) has now developed its successor: [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

:::

Quarto allows the creation of webpages, websites, presentations, books, pdf, etc. from code in R, Python, or Julia and markdown text.

If you are interested in an introduction to this tool, you can have a look at [our workshop](https://mint.westdri.ca/tools/quarto.html) or [our webinar](https://mint.westdri.ca/tools/quarto_webinar.html) on Quarto.

By the way, this entire website was created with Quarto 🙂
