:::{.def}

R is a free and open-source programming language with a large collection of packages for statistical computing, modeling, and graphics. It is extremely popular in several academic fields including statistics, biology, economics, data mining, data analysis, and linguistics.

This high-level presentation will give you a sense of what R can be used for through a series of examples (data visualization, web scraping, and GIS). I will also talk about the strengths and weaknesses of R and who would benefit most from learning it.
