This section covers the various ways R can be run, then shows you how to access our temporary RStudio server for this course.

:::

## Running R

R being an interpreted language, it can be run non-interactively or interactively.

### Running R non-interactively

If you write code in a text file (called a script), you can then execute it with:

```{.r}
Rscript my_script.R
```

:::{.note}

The command to execute scripts is `Rscript` rather than `R`. \
By convention, R scripts take the extension `.R`.

:::

### Running R interactively

There are several ways to run R interactively.

- Directly in the **console** (the name for the R shell):

- In **[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)** with the R kernel ([IRkernel package](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/IRkernel/index.html)).
- In **another IDE** (e.g. in Emacs with [ESS](https://ess.r-project.org/)).
- In the **RStudio IDE**.

The RStudio IDE is popular and this is what we will use today. RStudio can can be run locally, but for this course, we will use an RStudio server.

## Accessing our RStudio server

You do not need to install anything on your machine for this course as we will provide access to a temporary RStudio server.

:::{.example}

A username, a password, and the URL of the RStudio server will be given to you during the workshop.

:::

Sign in using the username and password you will be given while ignoring the OTP entry. This will take you to the server options page of a JupyterHub.

:::{.info}

Select the following server options:

- Time: **4 hours**
- Number of cores: **1**
- Memory: **3700 MB**
- User interface: **JupyterLab**

:::

Then press "Start" to launch the JupyterHub. There, click on the "RStudio" button and the RStudio server will open in a new tab.

:::{.note}

Note that this temporary cluster will only be available for the duration of this course.

## Using RStudio

For those unfamiliar with the RStudio IDE, you can download the following cheatsheet:
