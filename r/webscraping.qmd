The internet is a trove of information. A lot of it is publicly available and thus suitable for use in research. Extracting that information and putting it in an organized format for analysis can, however, be extremely tedious. Web scraping tools allow to automate parts of that process and R is a popular language for the task.

In this workshop, we will guide you through a simple example using the package [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/).

:::

<!-- Site to use as an example: -->
<!-- https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/index.html -->
<!-- 1. Scrape all the links of that page into a list -->
<!-- 2. Use each link to extract the information "Date of Award", "Degree Type", etc. through a big loop -->
