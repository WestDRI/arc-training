In this webinar, we will create inset maps, faceted maps, animated maps, interactive mapping applications, cartograms, raster maps, and bridge over from R to QGIS thanks to the packages sf, tmap, raster, leaflet, shiny, ggplot2, ggmap, grid, mapview, cartogram, and qgisprocess.

We will create inset maps, faceted maps, animated maps, cartograms, and raster maps. We will also add basemaps from OpenStreetMap and Google Maps.

All this thanks to the packages sf, tmap, raster, ggplot2, ggmap, grid, mapview, cartogram, and RgoogleMaps.

## Getting the data

### Datasets

For this webinar, we will use:

- the Alaska as well as the Western Canada and USA subsets of the [Randolph Glacier Inventory version 6.0](http://www.glims.org/RGI/)[^1]
- the [USGS time series of the named glaciers of Glacier National Park](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58af7022e4b01ccd54f9f542)[^2]
  The datasets can be downloaded as zip files from these websites.

### Basemaps

For our basemaps, we will use data from:

- [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/): this dataset can be accessed direction from within R thanks to the packages *rnaturalearth* (which provides the functions) and *rnaturalearthdata* (which provides the data)

## Loading and exploring data

First, let's load the necessary packages for this webinar:

```{.r}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(purrr)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
library(mapview)
library(grid) # part of base R (already installed), but needs to be explicitly loaded
```

We will start by mapping all the glaciers of Western North America thanks to:

- the Alaska subset of the [Randolph Glacier Inventory](http://www.glims.org/RGI/)
- the Western Canada and USA subset of the [Randolph Glacier Inventory](http://www.glims.org/RGI/)

Download and unzip `02_rgi60_WesternCanadaUS` and `01_rgi60_Alaska` from the [Randolph Glacier Inventory](http://www.glims.org/RGI/) version 6.0.

Data get imported and turned into *sf* objects by the function `sf::st_read()`:

```{.r}
ak <- st_read("01_rgi60_Alaska")
wes <- st_read("02_rgi60_WesternCanadaUS")
```

:::{.note}

Make sure to use the absolute paths or the proper paths relative to your working directory (which can be obtained with `getwd()` and modified with `setwd()`).

:::

You can print and explore your new objects:

```{.r}
ak
wes

str(ak)
str(wes)
```

*sf* objects are data.frame-like objects with a `geometry` list-column as their last column. That column is itself an object of class *sfc* (simple feature geometry list column).

## Mapping with tmap

*tmap* follows a grammar of graphic similar to that of *ggplot2*: you first need to set a shape (a spatial data object) by passing an *sf* object to `tm_shape()`. Then you plot one or several layers with one of several *tmap* functions and you use the `+` sign between each element.

To see the available options, run:

```{.r}
?tmap-element
```

We could thus plot the glaciers of Alaska with any of the options below:

```{.r}
tm_shape(ak) +
  tm_borders()

tm_shape(ak) +
  tm_fill()

tm_shape(ak) +
  tm_polygons()      # shows both borders and fill
```

Here, we will use `tm_polygons()` which combines `tm_borders()` and `tm_fill()`.

## Layout elements and attribute layers

A map without title, compass, or scale bars is not very useful though. We need to add layout elements and attribute layers to the map.

You can loop up the many arguments of the *tmap* functions in the help pages to see how you can customize your maps:

```{.r}
?tm_layout
?tm_compass
?tm_scale_bar
```

Let's now map the glaciers of Alaska:

```{.r}
tm_shape(ak) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_layout(
    title = "Glaciers of Alaska",
    title.position = c("center", "top"),
    title.size = 1.1,
    bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    inner.margins = c(0.06, 0.01, 0.09, 0.01),
    outer.margins = 0,
    frame.lwd = 0.2
  ) +
  tm_compass(
    type = "arrow",
    position = c("right", "top"),
    size = 1.2,
    text.size = 0.6
  ) +
  tm_scale_bar(
    breaks = c(0, 500, 1000),
    position = c("right", "BOTTOM")
  )
```

![](img/ak.jpg)

## Union of bounding boxes

Now, if we want to plot all the glaciers of Western North America, we want to combine both *sf* objects in the same map. A map can contain multiple shapes: you only need to "add" a `tm_shape` and its element(s). Before doing so however, it is very important to ensure that they have the same coordinate reference system (CRS):

```{.r}
st_crs(ak)
st_crs(wes)

st_crs(ak) == st_crs(wes)
```

They do, so we are good to go.

:::{.note}

As with *ggplot2* or GIS graphical user interfaces, the order matters since the layers stack up on top of each other.

:::

```{.r}
tm_shape(ak) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(wes) +
  tm_polygons()
```

If you run the code above however, you may be surprised that you are still only plotting the map of Alaska.

This is because each map comes with a spatial bounding box (`bbox`).

```{.r}
st_bbox(ak)
st_bbox(wes)
```

In the code above, the `bbox` is set by the first shape, i.e. our entire map uses the `bbox` of the Alaska *sf* object.

We first need to create a new bounding box encompassing both bounding boxes:

```{.r}
nwa_bbox <- st_bbox(
  st_union(
    st_as_sfc(st_bbox(wes)),
    st_as_sfc(st_bbox(ak))
  )
)
```

We can now plot the glaciers of Western North America:

```{.r}
tm_shape(ak, bbox = nwa_bbox) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(wes) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_layout(
    title = "Glaciers of Western North America",
    title.position = c("center", "top"),
    title.size = 1.1,
    bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    inner.margins = c(0.06, 0.01, 0.09, 0.01),
    outer.margins = 0,
    frame.lwd = 0.2
  ) +
  tm_compass(
    type = "arrow",
    position = c("right", "top"),
    size = 1.2,
    text.size = 0.6
  ) +
  tm_scale_bar(
    breaks = c(0, 1000, 2000),
    position = c("right", "BOTTOM")
  )
```

## Maps based on an attribute variable

What is interesting about glacier maps is to see their evolution through time as glaciers retreat due to climate change. While the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) has an amazing map in terms of spacial coverage, it doesn't yet have much temporal data.

To look at glacier retreat, we will look at the [USGS time series of the named glaciers of Glacier National Park](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58af7022e4b01ccd54f9f542)[^2]. These 4 datasets have the contour lines of 39 glaciers for the years 1966, 1998, 2005, and 2015.

We could load and clean these datasets one by one. Copying and pasting code however is inefficient and error-prone. A better approach is to do this in a functional programming framework: create a function which does all the data loading and cleaning, then pass each element of a vector of the paths of all 4 datasets to it using `purrr::map()`.

"Cleaning" here consists of selecting the variables we are interested in, putting them in the same order in each dataset (they were not initially) and giving the exact same name across all datasets (there were case inconsistencies between datasets and R is case sensitive).

```{.r}
## create a function that reads and cleans the data
prep <- function(dir) {
  g <- st_read(dir)
  g %<>% rename_with(~ tolower(gsub("Area....", "area", .x)))
  g %<>% select(
    year,
    objectid,
    glacname,
    area,
    shape_leng,
    x_coord,
    y_coord,
    source_sca,
    source
  )
}

## create a vector of dataset names
dirs <- grep("GNPglaciers_.*", list.dirs(), value = T)

## pass each element of that vector through prep() thanks to map()
gnp <- map(dirs, prep)
```

`map()` returns a list, so we now have a list (`gnp`) of 4 elements: the 4 *sf* objects containing our cleaned datasets. A list is not really convenient and we will turn it into a single *sf* object.

Before doing so however, we want to make sure that they all have the same CRS:

```{.r}
st_crs(gnp[[1]]) == st_crs(gnp[[2]])
st_crs(gnp[[1]]) == st_crs(gnp[[3]])
st_crs(gnp[[1]]) == st_crs(gnp[[4]])
```

They do, so we can turn `gnp` into a single *sf* object:

```{.r}
gnp <- do.call("rbind", gnp)

gnp
str(gnp)
```

We can now map the data:

```{.r}
tm_shape(gnp) +
  tm_polygons("year", palette = "Blues") +
  tm_layout(
    title = "Glaciers of Glacier National Park",
    title.position = c("center", "top"),
    legend.title.color = "#fcfcfc",
    legend.text.size = 1,
    bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    inner.margins = c(0.07, 0.03, 0.07, 0.03),
    outer.margins = 0
  ) +
  tm_compass(
    type = "arrow",
    position = c("right", "top"),
    text.size = 0.7
  ) +
  tm_scale_bar(
    breaks = c(0, 10, 20),
    position = c("right", "BOTTOM"),
    text.size = 1
  )
```

:::{.note}

I didn't want to show the legend title and because there is no option to remove it, I set its color to that of the background.

## CRS transformation

Wouldn't it be nice to have this map as an inset of the previous map so that we can situate it within North America?

Before we can do this, we need to make sure that both maps use the same CRS:

```{.r}
st_crs(ak)
st_crs(gnp)
```

:::{.note}

We could use `wes` instead of `ak` since we know that both *sf* objects have the same CRS.

:::

They don't have the same CRS, so we reproject `gnp` by transforming its data from its current CRS to that of `ak`.

```{.r}
gnp <- st_transform(gnp, st_crs(ak))
st_crs(gnp)
```

## Inset map

Now we can create our map with an inset: the map of the Western North America glaciers (from the *sf* object `nwa`) will be our main map and the map of Glacier National Park (from the *sf* object `gnp`) will be the inset.

If the goal of this new map is to show the location of the `gnp` map within the `nwa` one, we need to add a rectangle showing the bounding box of `gnp` in the `nwa` map as a new layer.

For this, we create a new *sfc_POLYGON* from the bounding box of `gnp`:

```{.r}
gnp_zone <- st_bbox(gnp) %>%
  st_as_sfc()
```

We will use it as the following layer within the new map:

```{.r}
tm_shape(gnp_zone) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 1.5, col = "#ff9900")
```

We assign our new map (with an updated suitable title) to the object `main_map`:

```{.r}
main_map <- tm_shape(ak, bbox = nwa_bbox) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(wes) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(gnp_zone) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 1.5, col = "#ff9900") +
  tm_layout(
    title = "Glaciers of Glacier National Park",
    title.position = c("center", "top"),
    title.size = 1.1,
    bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    inner.margins = c(0.06, 0.01, 0.09, 0.01),
    outer.margins = 0,
    frame.lwd = 0.2
  ) +
  tm_compass(
    type = "arrow",
    position = c("right", "top"),
    size = 1.2,
    text.size = 0.6
  ) +
  tm_scale_bar(
    breaks = c(0, 500, 1000),
    position = c("right", "BOTTOM")
  )
```

Next, we will change the frame of the `gnp` inset to match the color of this new rectangle (to make it visually clear that this is a close-up view of that rectangle). We can also remove the title, compass and scale bar since this is an inset within a map which already have them. We assign this new map to the object `inset_map`:

```{.r}
inset_map <- tm_shape(gnp) +
  tm_polygons("year", palette = "Blues") +
  tm_layout(
    legend.title.color = "#fcfcfc",
    legend.text.size = 0.7,
    bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    inner.margins = c(0.03, 0.03, 0.03, 0.03),
    outer.margins = 0,
    frame = "#ff9900",
    frame.lwd = 3
  )
```

Finally, we combine the two maps with `grid::viewport()`:

```{.r}
main_map
print(inset_map, vp = viewport(0.41, 0.26, width = 0.5, height = 0.5))
```

## Tiled web maps with Leaflet

Tiled web maps are interactive maps in a browser using web servers such as Google Maps or OpenStreetMap. Several packages allow to use [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) (an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps) to create tile maps.

### With *mapview*

The simplest option is to use `mapview::mapview()`:

```{.r}
mapview(gnp)
```

This will open a page in your browser in which you can pan, zoom, select/deselect data layers, and choose from a number of basemap layer options:

![](img/mapview4.jpg)
[CartoDB.Positron]{.caption}

![](img/mapview1.jpg)
[OpenTopoMap]{.caption}

![](img/mapview3.jpg)
[OpenStreetMap]{.caption}

![](img/mapview2.jpg)
[Esri.WorldImagery]{.caption}

### With *tmap*

*tmap* has similar capabilities.

The package has 2 modes:

- *plot* is the default mode for static maps that we used earlier.

- *view* is an interactive viewing mode using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) in a browser. There, as with *mapview*, you can zoom in/out, select/deselect the different layers, and choose to display one of *Esri.WorldGrayCanvas*, *OpenStreetMap*, or *Esri.WorldTopoMap* basemaps.

You can toggle between the *plot* and *view* modes with `ttm()`, after which you can re-plot your last plot in the new mode with `tmap_last()`. You can also do both of these at once with `ttmp()`.

Alternatively, you can switch to either mode with `tmap_mode("view")` and `tmap_mode("plot")`.

:::{.note}

Example:

:::

Earlier, we plotted all the glaciers of Western North America using *tmap*:

![](img/nwa.jpg)

After displaying this map, we could have run:

```{.r}
tmap_mode("view")
tmap_last()
```

And Leaflet would have open the following interactive map in our browser:

![](img/nwa_leaflet.jpg)

:::{.note}


Afterwards, if you want to create new static plots, don't forget to get back to *plot* mode with `tmap_mode("plot")`.

:::

## Mapping a subset of the data

Each glacier has 4 borders: one for each year of survey. They are however quite hard to see on such a large map.

Let's zoom on the Agassiz glacier:

```{.r}
## select the data points corresponding to the Agassiz Glacier
ag <- g %>% filter(glacname == "Agassiz Glacier")
```

And map it:

```{.r}
tm_shape(ag) +
  tm_polygons("year", palette = "Blues") +
  tm_layout(
    title = "Agassiz Glacier",
    title.position = c("center", "top"),
    legend.position = c("left", "bottom"),
    legend.title.color = "#fcfcfc",
    legend.text.size = 1,
    bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    inner.margins = c(0.07, 0.03, 0.07, 0.03),
    outer.margins = 0
  ) +
  tm_compass(
    type = "arrow",
    position = c("right", "top"),
    text.size = 0.7
  ) +
  tm_scale_bar(
    breaks = c(0, 0.5, 1),
    position = c("right", "BOTTOM"),
    text.size = 1
  )
```

![](img/ag.png){width="60%"}

Now we can clearly see the retreat of the Agassiz Glacier between 1966 and 2015.

## Faceted map

Instead of having all temporal data in a single map however, it can be split across facets:

```{.r}
tm_shape(ag) +
  tm_polygons(col = "#86baff") +
  tm_layout(
    main.title = "Agassiz Glacier",
    main.title.position = c("center", "top"),
    main.title.size = 1.2,
    legend.position = c("left", "bottom"),
    legend.title.color = "#fcfcfc",
    legend.text.size = 1,
    bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    ## inner.margins = c(0, 0.03, 0, 0.03),
    outer.margins = 0,
    panel.label.bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    frame = F,
    asp = 0.6
  ) +
  tm_compass(
    type = "arrow",
    position = c("right", "top"),
    size = 1,
    text.size = 0.6
  ) +
  tm_scale_bar(
    breaks = c(0, 0.5, 1),
    position = c("right", "BOTTOM"),
    text.size = 0.6
  ) +
  tm_facets(
    by = "year",
    free.coords = F,
    ncol = 4
  )
```

![](img/agfacet.png)

## Animated map

The temporal data of the Agassiz Glacier retreat can also be conveyed through an animation:

```{.r}
agassiz_anim <- tm_shape(ag) +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_fill(col = "#86baff") +
  tm_layout(
    title = "Agassiz Glacier",
    title.position = c("center", "top"),
    legend.position = c("left", "bottom"),
    legend.title.color = "#fcfcfc",
    legend.text.size = 1,
    bg.color = "#fcfcfc",
    inner.margins = c(0.08, 0, 0.08, 0),
    outer.margins = 0
  ) +
  tm_compass(
    type = "arrow",
    position = c("right", "top"),
    text.size = 0.7
  ) +
  tm_scale_bar(
    breaks = c(0, 0.5, 1),
    position = c("right", "BOTTOM"),
    text.size = 1
  ) +
  tm_facets(
    along = "year",
    free.coords = F
  )

tmap_animation(
  agassiz_anim,
  filename = "ag.gif",
  dpi = 300,
  inner.margins = c(0.08, 0, 0.08, 0),
  delay = 100
)
```
