In this webinar, we will see how to create all sorts of GIS maps with the packages [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf), [tmap](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap), [raster](https://github.com/rspatial/raster), [leaflet](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet), [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2), grid (part of Base R), and [mapview](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview):

- simple maps
- inset maps
- faceted maps
- animated maps
- interactive maps
- raster maps

Finally, we will learn how to add basemaps from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=3/71.34/-96.82) and [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).
