:::{.def}

R is not known for its speed. However, with some code optimization, it can be used for relatively heavy computations. Additional speedup can be achieved through various parallel techniques, both with multi-threading and distributed computing.

This workshop will introduce you to working with R from the command line on the Alliance clusters with a focus on performance. We will discuss code profiling and benchmarking, various packages for parallelization, as well as using C++ from inside R to speed up your calculations.
