:::{.def}

One of the strengths of R is its great documentation. Here, we will learn how to make use of it.

:::

## General documentation

To get started with R, you can launch the general documentation with:

```{.r}
help.start()
```

## Help on functions

To get help on specific objects (e.g. the function `sum`), you can run:

```{.r}
help(sum)
```

or:

```{.r}
?sum
```

:::{.info}

The documentation pages always follow the same format:

- Name of the object and the package it comes from
- A short description of the object
- The code to use it
- An explanation of the arguments (in the case of functions)
- Explanation with greater details
- The value returned (in the case of functions)
- Examples of code snippets that can be run
