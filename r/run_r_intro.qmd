:::{.def}

You do not need to install anything on your machine for this course as we will provide access to a temporary RStudio server.

:::

## Accessing the temporary RStudio server

:::{.example}

A username, a password, and the URL of the RStudio server will be given to you during the workshop.

:::

Sign in using the username and password you will be given while ignoring the OTP entry. This will take you to a JupyterHub. There, click on the "RStudio" button and the RStudio server will open in a new tab.

## Using RStudio

For those unfamiliar with the RStudio IDE, you can download the following cheatsheet:
