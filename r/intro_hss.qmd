R is a free and open-source programming language for statistical computing, modelling, and graphics, with an unbeatable collection of statistical packages. It is extremely popular in some academic fields such as statistics, biology, bioinformatics, data mining, data analysis, and linguistics.

This introductory course does not assume any prior knowledge: it will take you through the first steps of importing, cleaning, and visualizing your data. Along the way, we will get familiar with R data types, functions writing, and control flow.

## Running R

### Running R interactively

There are several ways to run R.

- Directly in the **console** (the name for the R shell):

- In **[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)** with the R kernel ([IRkernel package](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/IRkernel/index.html)).
- In the **RStudio IDE**.
- In **another IDE** (e.g. in Emacs with [ESS](https://ess.r-project.org/)).

The RStudio IDE is popular and this is what we will use today. RStudio can can be run locally, but for this course, we will use an RStudio server.

### Running R non-interactively

You can also run R scripts with:

```{.r}
Rscript my_script.R
```

### Accessing our RStudio server

To access it:

1.  Go to the website given during the workshop,
2.  Sign in using your username and password given during the workshop (you can ignore the OTP entry),
3.  Choose the following `Server Options`:

    - Time: `3.0` hours
    - Number of cores: `1`
    - Memory: `3600` MB
    - User interface: `JupyterLab`

4.  In JupyterLab, click on the RStudio button (big blue symbol with a white R in it).
