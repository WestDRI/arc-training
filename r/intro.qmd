R is a free and open-source programming language for statistical computing, modelling, and graphics, with an unbeatable collection of statistical packages. It is extremely popular in some academic fields such as statistics, biology, bioinformatics, data mining, data analysis, and linguistics.

This introductory course does not assume any prior knowledge: it will take you through the first steps of importing, cleaning, and visualizing your data. Along the way, we will get familiar with R data types, functions writing, and control flow.
