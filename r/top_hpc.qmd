R is not famous for its speed. With code optimization and parallelization, it can however be used for heavy computations.

This course will introduce you to working with R from the command line on the Alliance clusters with a focus on performance. We will discuss code profiling and benchmarking, various parallelization techniques, as well as using C++ from inside R to speed up calculations.
