### So many opportunities

Huge amounts of computing power readily available

### Open source on steroids

Explosion of tools, libraries, software, new programming languages \
Powerful ML algorithms \
Literate programming is finally mainstream

<br>
But...

- PIs often don't have experience with new tools and are unable to help their students\
- Departments are slow to add courses needed by students \
- Some fields don't have a strong computing culture
