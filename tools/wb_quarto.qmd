This webinar will show you how to easily create beautiful publications (webpages, pdf, websites, presentations, books…)—complete with formatted text, dynamic code and figures with Quarto.

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is the successor to [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). By combining the powers of Jupyter or knitr with Pandoc, it works with R, but also with Python and Julia code blocks and it adds new functionalities to the old tool.
