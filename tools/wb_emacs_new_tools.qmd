Emacs might have been created in the 70s, but development is alive and well:

Version 28 in 2022 added—among other things—optional just-in-time native compilation for elisp code for improved performance.

Version 29 in 2023 brought countless exciting new additions such as official [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) support and built-in [Eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) and [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-use-package).

In addition to Emacs itself, a profusion of modern packages have emerged over the past few years (e.g. the [vertico](https://github.com/minad/vertico)/[consult](https://github.com/minad/consult)/[orderless](https://github.com/oantolin/orderless)/[marginalia](https://github.com/minad/marginalia/)/[embark](https://github.com/oantolin/embark/) completion system; [corfu](https://github.com/minad/corfu) and [cape](https://github.com/minad/cape) for at point completion) bringing great speed and sleekness to the user experience.

This webinar will introduce some of these new developments so that you can make the most of Emacs.
