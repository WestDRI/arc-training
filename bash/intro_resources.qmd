This section lists a few useful Bash resources.

:::

One very useful (although very dense) resource is the [Bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html). This is the absolute reference.

There are countless sites with Bash courses and guides. Here are a few:

- [Bash Guide for Beginners](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html)
- [Learn X in Y minutes for Bash](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/bash/)
- [Linux Bash Shell Scripting Tutorial](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Main_Page)

You can also get information on Bash from within Bash with:

```{.bash}
info bash
```

and:

```{.bash}
man bash
```

There are also countless resources online and don't forget to Google anything you don't know how to do: you will almost certainly find the answer on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or some Stack Exchange site.
