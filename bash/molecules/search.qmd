## ***Data for this section***

For this section, we will be using data put together by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). You can download it by clicking [here](http://bit.ly/bashfile).

This will download a zip filed called `bfiles.zip`. Unzip it to your home directory. You should now see a `data-shell` directory. In it is a subdirectory called `molecules`.

This is what we will use for now, so `cd` into it:

```{.bash}
cd data-shell/molecules
```

## Command `find`

Search for files inside the current working directory:

```{.bash}
find . -type f
```

```
./methane.pdb
./pentane.pdb
./sorted.txt
./propane.pdb
./lengths.txt
./cubane.pdb
./ethane.pdb
./octane.pdb
```

`find . -type d` will instead search for directories inside the current working directory.

Here are other examples:

```{.bash}
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f     # depth 1 is the current directory
find . -mindepth 2 -type f     # current directory and one level down
find . -name haiku.txt      # finds specific file
ls data       # shows one.txt two.txt
find . -name *.txt      # still finds one file -- why? answer: expands *.txt to haiku.txt
find . -name '*.txt'    # finds all three files -- good!
```

Let's wrap the last command into `$()`—called *command substitution*—as if it were a variable:

```{.bash}
echo $(find . -name '*.txt')   # will print ./data/one.txt ./data/two.txt ./haiku.txt
ls -l $(find . -name '*.txt')   # will expand to ls -l ./data/one.txt ./data/two.txt ./haiku.txt
wc -l $(find . -name '*.txt')   # will expand to wc -l ./data/one.txt ./data/two.txt ./haiku.txt
grep elegant $(find . -name '*.txt')   # will look for 'elegant' inside all *.txt files
```

Your turn:

:::

`grep`'s `-v` flag inverts pattern matching, so that only lines that do **not** match the pattern are printed.

Given that, which of the following commands will find all files in `/data` whose names end in `ose.dat` (e.g. `sucrose.dat` or `maltose.dat`), but do not contain the word `temp`?

1. `find /data -name '*.dat' | grep ose | grep -v temp`
2. `find /data -name ose.dat | grep -v temp`
3. `grep -v temp $(find /data -name '*ose.dat')`
4. None of the above

## Running a command on the results of `find`

Let's say that you want to run a command on each of the files in the output of `find`. You can always do something using command substitution like this:

```{.bash}
for f in $(find . -name "*.txt")
do
    command on $f
done
```

Alternatively, you can make it a one-liner:

```{.bash}
find . -name "*.txt" -exec command {} \;
```

Another—perhaps more elegant—one-line alternative is to use `xargs`. In its simplest usage, `xargs` command lets you construct a list of arguments:

```{.bash}
find . -name "*.txt"                   # returns multiple lines
find . -name "*.txt" | xargs           # use those lines to construct a list
find . -name "*.txt" | xargs command   # pass this list as arguments to `command`
command $(find . -name "*.txt")        # command substitution, achieving the same result (this is riskier!)
command `(find . -name "*.txt")`       # alternative syntax for command substitution
```

In these examples, `xargs` achieves the same result as command substitution, but it is safer in terms of memory usage and the length of lists you can pass.

When would you need to use this? A good example is with the command `grep`. `grep` takes a search stream (and not a list of files) as its standard input:

```{.bash}
cat filename | grep pattern
```

To pass a list of files to grep, you can use `xargs` that takes that list from its standard input and converts it into a list of arguments that is then passed to `grep`:

```{.bash}
find . -name "*.txt" | xargs grep pattern   # search for `pattern` inside all those files (`grep` does not take a list of files as standard input)
```

<!-- Write a one-line command that will search for a string in all files in the current directory and all its subdirectories and will hide errors (e.g. due to permissions). -->

<!-- Play with command substitution using both `$(...)` and ``` `...` ``` syntax. -->
