```{r}

Let's experiment with quotes:

```{bash}
variable=This string is the value of the variable
echo $variable
```

Oops...

```{bash}
variable="This string is the value of the variable"
echo $variable
```

```{bash}
variable='This string is the value of the variable'
echo $variable
```

```{bash}
variable='This string's the value of the variable'
echo $variable
```

Oops...

One solution to this is to use double quotes:

```{bash}
variable="This string's the value of the variable"
echo $variable
```

Alternatively, single quotes can be escaped:

```{bash}
variable='This string'"'"'s the value of the variable'
echo $variable
```

:::{.note}

Admittedly, this last one is a little crazy. It is the way to escape single quotes in single-quoted strings.

The first `'` ends the first string, both `"` create a double-quoted string with `'` (escaped) in it, then the last `'` starts the second string.

Escaping double quotes is a lot easier and simply requires `\"`.
