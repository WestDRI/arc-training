[Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) is another Unix shell, very similar to Bash but with more functionality and ease of use.

:::

## Installation

`zsh` is installed on the Alliance clusters. It is now also the default shell on MacOS. For Windows users, you will probably have to use WSL. [Here](https://walterteng.com/using-zsh-on-windows) is a suggested setup (Unix shells such as Bash and Zsh are built for Unix systems and Windows is not a Unix system).

## First launch

When you launch `zsh` for the first time, a little program runs to help you create the Zsh config file `.zshrc` and set some options.

## Useful plugins

Out of the box, Zsh is nicer than Bash, but in addition, there are many additional niceties that have been built for it.

[oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) is a popular project and it contains many useful configurations and add-ons, but it also contain a lot of unnecessary things and is quite bloated.

I personally prefer to keep things simpler and install 3 great plugins:

- [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting),
- [autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions?tab=readme-ov-file), and
- [history substring search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search).

To install these plugins, you only have to clone the repos and source some scripts.

Clone the repos (you only need to do this once):

```{.bash}
# create a directory to store the scripts
mkdir ~/.zsh_plugins

# syntax highlighting
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ~/.zsh_plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting

# autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git ~/.zsh_plugins/zsh-autosuggestions

# history substring search
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search.git ~/.zsh_plugins/zsh-history-substring-search
```

Source the scripts. You need to do this at each session, so you should add this to your `.zshrc` file:

```{.bash}
source ~/.zsh_plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
source ~/.zsh_plugins/zsh-history-substring-search/zsh-history-substring-search.zsh
source ~/.zsh_plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
```

Now paste the function we saw previously in zsh:

```{.bash}
function proc_kill {
    local pid
    pid=$(ps -ef |
	      sed 1d |
	      fzf --cycle --reverse -i -e -m --bind "ctrl-o:toggle-all" \
		  --header "Tab: toggle, C-o: toggle-all" |
	      awk '{print $2}')
    echo $pid | xargs kill -${1:-15}
}
```

and you will see the wonders of syntax highlighting in your shell inputs.

To use the history substring search, start typing some command then press `Alt + p` or `Alt + n` to cycle through all entries in your history that start with what you already typed.

Finally, the autosuggestion will suggestion commands based on your history. You can accept the whole command with `Ctl + e` or accept a single word with `Alt + f`.
