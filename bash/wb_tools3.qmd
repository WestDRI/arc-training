title: Modern shell utilities
author: Marie-Hélène Burle

:::{.def}

In recent years, a number of open-source utilities for the Unix shell have emerged. Some are meant as replacements for classic tools with improved performance, better defaults, or nicer-looking outputs; others add novel functionality. Several of them were recently installed on the Alliance clusters.

In this webinar I will cover a selection of tools that are very popular, well-maintained, and that have served me well in my daily workflows:

- `ls` in colours: [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza),
- smart `cd`: [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide),
- a `cat` with wings: [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat),
- RIP `grep`: [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep),
- faster `find`: [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd),
- fuzzy finder: [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf),
- file system TUIs.

I will also talk about three useful [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) plugins:

- [a syntax highlighter](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting),
- [autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions),
- [an improved history searcher](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search).

For each tool/plugin, I will talk about installation on a personal computer and on the Alliance clusters and I will give live demos.
