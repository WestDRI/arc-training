One very useful (although very dense) resource is the [Bash manual.](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html)

You can also get information on Bash from within Bash with:

```{.bash}
info bash
```

and:

```{.bash}
man bash
```

There are also countless resources online and don't forget to Google anything you don't know how to do: you will almost certainly find the answer on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or some Stack Exchange site.
