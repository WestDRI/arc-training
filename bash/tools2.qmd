title: A few of our favourite tools
---

:::{.def}

[In a previous webinar](/bash/tools1.qmd), we presented three of our favourite command line tools. Today, we will introduce other tools we find really useful in our daily workflow:

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit): a wonderful terminal UI for Git,
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): a great syntax highlighter,
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): a fast alternative to `grep`,
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd): a /really/ fast alternative to `find`,
- [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/): a command line password manager.

Along the way, I will use a few other neat command line tools such as [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)—for sophisticated benchmarking—and [diff-so-fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy)—which makes your diffs a lot more readable.

For the Emacs users among you, we will finish the workshop with two Emacs utilities:

- [TRAMP](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode): a remote file access system,
- [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm): a "framework for incremental completions and narrowing selections".
