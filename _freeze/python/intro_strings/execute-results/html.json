To the world in general, and particularly on that bit of it known as the death warrant, he was Alfred Spangler.\\n\\nAnd he took a more positive approach to the situation and had concentrated his mind on the prospect of not being hanged in the morning, and, most particularly, on the prospect of removing all the crumbling mortar from around a stone in his cell wall with a spoon. So far the work had taken him five weeks and reduced the spoon to something like a nail file. Fortunately, no one ever came to change the bedding here, or else they would have discovered the world\\'s heaviest mattress.\\n\\nIt was a large and heavy stone that was currently the object of his attentions, and, at some point, a huge staple had been hammered into it as an anchor for manacles.\\n\\nMoist sat down facing the wall, gripped the iron ring in both hands, braced his legs against the stones on either side, and heaved.\\n\\nHis shoulders caught fire, and a red mist filled his vision, but the block slid out with a faint and inappropriate tinkling noise. Moist managed to ease it away from the hole and peered inside.\\n\\nAt the far end was another block, and the mortar around it looked suspiciously strong and fresh.\\n\\nJust in front of it was a new spoon. It was shiny.\\n\\nAs he studied it, he heard the clapping behind him. He turned his head, tendons twanging a little riff of agony, and saw several of the wardens watching him through the bars.\\n\\n\"Well done, Mr. Spangler!\" said one of them. \"Ron here owes me five dollars! I told him you were a sticker!! \\'He\\'s a sticker,\\' I said!\"\\n\\n\"You set this up, did you, Mr. Wilkinson?\" said Moist weakly, watching the glint of light on the spoon.\\n\\n\"Oh, not us, sir.

But there\\'s a damn great stone through there!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, there is that, sir, yes, there is that,\" said the warden. \"It\\'s only the prospect, you see. Not actual free freedom as such. Hah, that\\'d be a bit daft, eh?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose so, yes,\" said Moist. He didn\\'t say \"you bastards.\" The wardens had treated him quite civilly these past six weeks, and he made a point of getting on with people. He was very, very good at it. People skills were part of his stock-in-trade; they were nearly the whole of it.\\n\\nBesides, these people had big sticks. So, speaking carefully, he added: \"Some people might consider this cruel, Mr. Wilkinson.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, we asked him about that, sir, but he said no, it wasn\\'t.
