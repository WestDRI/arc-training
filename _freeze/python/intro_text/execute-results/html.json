In preparation for those, in this section, we will download a text file from the internet and play with it using simple commands.\n\n:::\n\n## Downloading a text file from an URL\n\nFirst, we need to load the [`urllib.request` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request) from the Python standard library. It contains functions to deal with URLs:\n\n::: {#df6a1f64 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport urllib.request\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe snippet of text we will play with is in a text file containing the very beginning of the novel [Going Postal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_Postal) by [Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett) and located at the URL <https://mint.westdri.ca/python/data/pratchett.txt>. We can create a variable that we call `url` (we can call it whatever we want) and that contains the string of the URL:\n\n::: {#95f16a55 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nurl = \"https://mint.westdri.ca/python/data/pratchett.txt\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#e5d930bc .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(url)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nhttps://mint.westdri.ca/python/data/pratchett.txt\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#96b8ea98 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntype(url)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=57}\n```\nstr\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo download a text file from a URL, we use the `urllib.request.urlopen` function:\n\n::: {#4dfeae83 .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nurllib.request.urlopen(url)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=58}\n```\n<http.client.HTTPResponse at 0x71434759a560>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis return an `HTTPResponse` object.

our question. Why?\n\n:::\n\nInstead, we should use the list of words that we called `words` and count how many of them are equal to `the`. We do this with a loop:\n\n::: {#1ca0d3ee .cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# We set our counter (the number of occurrences) to zero:\noccurrences = 0\n\n# And now we can use a loop to test the words one by one and add 1 to our counter each time the equality returns true\nfor word in words:\n    if word == \"the\":\n        occurrences += 1\n\nprint(occurrences)        \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n34\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAn alternative syntax that looks a lot more elegant is the following:\n\n::: {#8e336052 .cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nsum(word == \"the\" for word in words)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=69}\n```\n34\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowever, elegance and short syntax don't mean fast code.\n\nWe can benchmark Python code very easy when we use Jupyter or IPython by using the magic `%%timeit` at the top of a code cell.\n\nLet's try it:\n\n::: {#98ba31be .cell execution_count=18}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n%%timeit\n\n# We set our counter (the number of occurrences) to zero:\noccurrences = 0\n\n# And now we can use a loop to test the words one by one and add 1 to our counter each time the equality returns true\nfor word in words:\n    if word == \"the\":\n        occurrences += 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n9.52 μs ± 510 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.note}\n\nI removed the `print` function so that we don't end up printing the result a bunch of times: `timeit` does a lot of tests and takes the average.

Without benchmarking, it is very hard to predict what code is efficient.\n\n## Extracting characters from strings\n\n### Indexing\n\nLet's go back to our text. Remember that we have this object `text` which is a list.\n\n::: {#9cc9fdc5 .cell execution_count=20}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntype(text)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=72}\n```\nstr\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can extract characters from strings by *indexing*.\n\nIndexing in Python is done with square brackets and starts at 0 (the first element has index 0). This means that we can extract the first character with:\n\n::: {#a5eb3bcf .cell execution_count=21}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(text[0])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nT\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.exo}\n\n:::{.yourturn}\n\nYour turn:\n\n:::\n\nHow would you index the 4^th^ element?

You can see it when you don't use the `print` function (`print` makes things look nicer and transforms those characters into what they represent):\n\n::: {#df934339 .cell execution_count=23}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntext[-1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=75}\n```\n'\\n'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.exo}\n\n:::{.yourturn}\n\nYour turn:\n\n:::\n\n**Question 1:** \\\nHow would you get the last letter of the text?\n\n**Question 2:** \\\nHow would you index the 11^th^ element from the end? Give it a try. You should get \"V\".\n\n:::\n\n### Slicing\n\nYou can also extract multiple contiguous elements with a *slice*. A slice is also defined with square brackets, but this time you add a colon in it. Left of the colon is the start of the slice and right of the colon is the end of the slice.\n\nIn Python, the left element of a slice is *included*, but the right element is *excluded*.\n\nFirst, let's omit both indices on either side of the colon:\n\n::: {#343eae5b .cell execution_count=24}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(text[:])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThey say that the prospect of being hanged in the morning concentrates a man's mind wonderfully; unfortunately, what the mind inevitably concentrates on is that, in the morning, it will be in a body that is going to be hanged.\nThe man going to be hanged had been named Moist von Lipwig by doting if unwise parents, but he was not going to embarrass the name, insofar as that was still possible, by being hung under it.

This is because when a slice boundary is omitted, by default it starts at the very beginning of the object you are slicing.\n\nWe can test that we indeed get the full text by comparing it to the non-sliced version of `text`:\n\n::: {#52b30633 .cell execution_count=25}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntext[:] == text\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=77}\n```\nTrue\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, let's slice the first 10 elements of `text`:\n\n::: {#586d0f71 .cell execution_count=26}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(text[:10])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThey say t\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.hnote}\n\nLet's explain this code a bit:\n\nWe want our slice to start at the beginning of the text, so we are omitting that boundary (we could also use `0` left of the colon).\n\nBecause indexing starts at 0, the 10^th^ element is actually not \"t\", but the following \"h\". The reason we get \"t\" rather than \"h\" is because the right boundary of a slice is excluded.\n\n:::\n\n:::{.exo}\n\n:::{.yourturn}\n\nYour turn:\n\n:::\n\n**Question 1:** \\\nTry to write some code that will return \"prospect\".\n\n<!-- ```{python} -->\n<!-- text[18:26] -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n**Question 2:** \\\nNow, remember how we created the `words` object earlier? Try to use it to get the same result.\n\n<!-- ```{python} -->\n<!-- words[4] -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n:::\n\n## Striding\n\nA last way to extract characters out of a string is to use *strides*. A stride is defined with square brackets and 3 values separated by colons. The first value is the left boundary (included), the second value is the right boundary (excluded), and the third value is the step. By default (if omitted), the step is 1.\n\n:::{.exo}\n\n:::{.yourturn}\n\nYour turn:\n\n:::\n\n**Question 1:** \\\nWhat do you think that `text[::]` would return?\n\n**Question 2:** \\\nHow would you test it?\n\n**Question 3:** \\\nHow would you get every 3^rd^ character of the whole text?\n\n:::\n\nNow, a fun one: the step can also take a negative value. With `-1`, we get the text backward! This is because `-` indicates that we want to step from the end and `1` means that we want every character:\n\n::: {#40f0d3e0 .cell execution_count=27}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(text[::-1])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\".eliga yreV .nam llams yreV .ris ,niard taht nwod teg ot deganam eh ,llec siht ni dah ew ekolb tsal eht ylnO\"\n\"?nosnikliW .rM ,tespu eb I dluohs yhW ?tespU\"\n\"?ris ,uoy era ,tespu toN\"\n.ylmulg tsioM derettum \",epoH\"\n\".ris ,epoH si hcihw ,serusaert lla fo tsetaerg taht dereffo dna ,gnipom detneverp ,esicrexe yhtlaeh ,yp-par-reht lla-nuhs-yap-uoy-cco--\" delknirw daeherof sih--\"dedivorp ti dias eH .t'nsaw ti ,on dias eh tub ,ris ,taht tuoba mih deksa ew ,ris ,seY\"\n\".nosnikliW .rM ,leurc siht redisnoc thgim elpoep emoS\" :dedda eh ,ylluferac gnikaeps ,oS .skcits gib dah elpoep eseht ,sediseB\n.ti fo elohw eht ylraen erew yeht ;edart-ni-kcots sih fo trap erew slliks elpoeP .ti ta doog yrev ,yrev saw eH .elpoep htiw no gnitteg fo tniop a edam eh dna ,skeew xis tsap eseht yllivic etiuq mih detaert dah snedraw ehT \".sdratsab uoy\" yas t'ndid eH .tsioM dias \",sey ,os esoppus I\"\n\"?he ,tfad tib a eb d'taht ,haH .hcus sa modeerf eerf lautca toN .ees uoy ,tcepsorp eht ylno s'tI\" .nedraw eht dias \",taht si ereht ,sey ,ris ,taht si ereht ,seY\"\n\"!ereht hguorht enots taerg nmad a s'ereht tuB ?modeerF\"\n\".modeerf fo tcepsorp eht dereffo eb dluohs srenosirp denmednoc lla taht stsisni eH .sredro s'iraniteV droL .ris ,su ton ,hO\"\n.noops eht no thgil fo tnilg eht gnihctaw ,ylkaew tsioM dias \"?nosnikliW .rM ,uoy did ,pu siht tes uoY\"\n\"!dias I ',rekcits a s'eH' !!rekcits a erew uoy mih dlot I !srallod evif em sewo ereh noR\" .meht fo eno dias \"!relgnapS .rM ,enod lleW\"\n.srab eht hguorht mih gnihctaw snedraw eht fo lareves was dna ,ynoga fo ffir elttil a gnignawt snodnet ,daeh sih denrut eH .mih dniheb gnippalc eht draeh eh ,ti deiduts eh sA\n.ynihs saw tI .noops wen a saw ti fo tnorf ni tsuJ\n.hserf dna gnorts ylsuoicipsus dekool ti dnuora ratrom eht dna ,kcolb rehtona saw dne raf eht tA\n.edisni dereep dna eloh eht morf yawa ti esae ot deganam tsioM .esion gnilknit etairporppani dna tniaf a htiw tuo dils kcolb eht tub ,noisiv sih dellif tsim der a dna ,erif thguac sredluohs siH\n.devaeh dna ,edis rehtie no senots eht tsniaga sgel sih decarb ,sdnah htob ni gnir nori eht deppirg ,llaw eht gnicaf nwod tas tsioM\n.selcanam rof rohcna na sa ti otni deremmah neeb dah elpats eguh a ,tniop emos ta ,dna ,snoitnetta sih fo tcejbo eht yltnerruc saw taht enots yvaeh dna egral a saw tI\n.sserttam tseivaeh s'dlrow eht derevocsid evah dluow yeht esle ro ,ereh gniddeb eht egnahc ot emac reve eno on ,yletanutroF .elif lian a ekil gnihtemos ot noops eht decuder dna skeew evif mih nekat dah krow eht raf oS .noops a htiw llaw llec sih ni enots a dnuora morf ratrom gnilbmurc eht lla gnivomer fo tcepsorp eht no ,ylralucitrap tsom ,dna ,gninrom eht ni degnah gnieb ton fo tcepsorp eht no dnim sih detartnecnoc dah dna noitautis eht ot hcaorppa evitisop erom a koot eh dnA\n.relgnapS derflA saw eh ,tnarraw htaed eht sa nwonk ti fo tib taht no ylralucitrap dna ,lareneg ni dlrow eht oT .ti rednu gnuh gnieb yb ,elbissop llits saw taht sa rafosni ,eman eht ssarrabme ot gniog ton saw eh tub ,stnerap esiwnu fi gnitod yb giwpiL nov tsioM deman neeb dah degnah eb ot gniog nam ehT\n.degnah eb ot gniog si taht ydob a ni eb lliw ti ,gninrom eht ni ,taht si no setartnecnoc ylbativeni dnim eht tahw ,yletanutrofnu ;yllufrednow dnim s'nam a setartnecnoc gninrom eht ni degnah gnieb fo tcepsorp eht taht yas yehT\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<!-- ```{python} -->\n<!-- def end_of_sentence_marker(char): -->\n<!--     if char == \".\" or char == \"?\" or char == \"!\": -->\n<!--         return True -->\n<!--     else: -->\n<!--         return False -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- ```{python} -->\n<!-- #
