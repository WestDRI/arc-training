This is leading to a vast and ever evolving field of implementations which can be disorienting.\n\nIn this webinar, I will guide you through a map of the current frameworks, organizing them based on their domain (machine learning vs deep learning) and the languages required to use them. I will also talk about the various automatic differentiation options available.\n\nTo narrow such a large topic, I am limiting the map to frameworks that can be used from Python, Julia, and R.\n\n:::\n\n[Slides](frameworks_slides.qmd){.btn .btn-outline-primary} [(Click and wait: this reveal.js presentation is heavy and takes quite a long time to load...)]{.inlinenote}\n<br><br>\n\n<!-- {{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/ >}} -->\n\n\n```{neato}\ngraph {\na [image=\"ARC_Map_English.jpg\"]\n}\n```\n\n",
