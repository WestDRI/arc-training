Here is a first basic orientation.\n\n:::\n\n## The prompt\n\nIn command-line interfaces, a command prompt is a sequence of characters indicating that the interpreter is ready to accept input. It can also provide some information (e.g. time, error types, username and hostname, etc.)\n\nThe Bash prompt is customizable. By default, it often gives the username and the hostname, and it typically ends with `$`.\n\n## Commands\n\n:::{.example}\n\nExamples of commands:\n\n:::\n\n- Print working directory: `pwd`\n- Change directory: `cd`\n- Print: `echo`\n- Print content of a file: `cat`\n- List: `ls`\n- Copy: `cp`\n- Move or rename: `mv`\n- Create a new directory: `mkdir`\n- Create a new file: `touch`\n\n### Help on commands\n\nMan pages:\n\n```{.bash}\nman <command>\n```\n\n:::{.note}\n\nMan pages open in a pager (usually `less`).\\\nNavigate up/down with the space bar and the `b` key.\\\nQuit the pager with the `q` key.\n\n:::\n\nHelp pages:\n\n```{.bash}\n<command> --help\n```\n\nInspect commands:\n\n```{.bash}\ncommand -V <command>\n```\n\n## Keybindings\n\nClear the terminal (command `clear`) with C-l (this means: press the Ctrl and L keys at the same time).\n\nNavigate command history with C-p and C-n (or up and down arrows).\n\nYou can auto-complete commands by pressing the tab key.\n\n## Comments\n\nAnything to the left of `#` is ignored by the interpreter and is for human consumption only.\n\n```{.bash}\n# You can write full-line comments\n\npwd\t\t  # You can also write comments after commands\n```\n",
