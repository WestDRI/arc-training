It doesn't require the preallocation of an output container, it brings to R an equivalent of the Python or Julia list comprehensions, and mostly, it allows for an easy execution of loops in parallel. Unlike loops, it creates variables (loops are used for their side-effect).\n\nWe will explore an example to calculate the sum of 1e3 random vectors of length 3.\n\nFirst, let's launch an interactive job with a single task (by default Slurm grants one CPU per task, so we are asking for one CPU):\n\n```{.bash}\nsalloc --time=50 --mem-per-cpu=3700M --ntasks=1\n```\n\n:::{.note}\n\nYou can see the full list of `salloc` options [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/salloc.html).\n\n:::\n\nThen we can launch R interactively:\n\n```{.bash}\nR\n```\n\n:::{.note}\n\nWe are now in the R terminal and can start typing R commands.\n\n:::\n\nLet's load the `foreach` package:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='hpc_parallel_loops_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_8fb0a22ae861cb47184b34366e6d968e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(foreach)\n```\n:::\n\n\nBelow is a classic while loop:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='hpc_parallel_loops_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_da3237df4b4b75754fafeb688a6c5ff8'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(2)\nresult1 <- numeric(3)             # Preallocate output container\ni <- 0                            # Initialise counter variable\n\nwhile(i < 1e3) {\n  result1 <- result1 + runif(3)   # Calculate the sum\n  i <- i + 1                      # Update the counter\n}\n\nresult1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 509.4325 504.8698 496.6869\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere is the equivalent code using `foreach`:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='hpc_parallel_loops_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_6ff6aeaa4874bab956e5afdfae34d7c6'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(2)\nresult2 <- foreach(i = 1:1e3, .combine = '+') %do% runif(3)\n\nresult2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 509.4325 504.8698 496.6869\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can verify that both expressions return the same result:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='hpc_parallel_loops_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_a931a7cf1cf3ffff0ed342bae285e87c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nidentical(result1, result2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe best part of `foreach` is that you can turn sequential loops into parallel ones.\n\nThere are many parallelization backends available: `doFuture`, `doMC`, `doMPI`, `doParallel`, `doRedis`, `doRNG`, `doSNOW`, and `doAzureParallel`.\n\nIn this lesson, we will use [`doFuture`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doFuture/index.html), a modern package which allows to evaluate `foreach` expressions following any of the strategies of the [`future`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/index.html) package.\n\nSo first, what is the [`future`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/index.html) package?\n\n## The `future` package\n\nA [future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) is an object that acts as an abstract representation for a value in the future. A future can be *resolved* (if the value has been computed) or *unresolved*. If the value is queried while the future is unresolved, the process is blocked until the future is resolved. Futures thus allow for asynchronous and parallel evaluations.\n\nThe [`future`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/index.html) package allows to evaluate futures sequentially or in various forms of parallelism while keeping code simple and consistent. The evaluation strategy is set thanks to the `plan` function:\n\n- `plan(sequential)`: \\\nFutures are evaluated sequentially in the current R session.\n\n- `plan(multisession)`: \\\nFutures are evaluated by new R sessions spawned in the background (*multi-processing in shared memory*).\n\n- `plan(multicore)`: \\\nFutures are evaluated in processes forked from the existing process (*multi-processing in shared memory*).\n\n- `plan(cluster)`: \\\nFutures are evaluated on an ad-hoc cluster (*distributed parallelism* across multiple nodes).\n\n:::{.note}\n\n###### Consistency\n\nTo ensure a consistent behaviour across plans, all evaluations are done in a local environment:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='hpc_parallel_loops_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_b159d88056d8b979bde991a92338508a'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(future)\n\na <- 1\n\nb %<-% {      # %<-% is used instead of <- to use futures\n  a <- 2\n}\n\na\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## The `doFuture` package\n\nThe [`doFuture`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doFuture/index.html) package allows to evaluate `foreach` expressions across the evaluation strategies of the [`future`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/index.html) package very easily.\n\nLet's load the `doFuture` package:\n\n```{.r}\nlibrary(doFuture)\n```\n\n:::{.note}\n\nThis automatically loads the `foreach` and `future` packages.\n\n:::\n\nWe need to choose an evaluation strategy for our futures (e.g. `plan(multicore)`):\n\n```{.r}\nplan(multicore)\n```\n\nTo run the code in parallel, we can now replace `%do%` with `%dofuture%`.\n\nThere is however one last twist: whenever you create random numbers in parallel, it isn't enough to use `set.seed()` to ensure reproducibility. You also need to make sure to generate parallel-safe random numbers. Using the `%seed%` operator (with `%seed% TRUE`) or the option `.options.future = list(seed = TRUE)` pregenerates the random seeds for all iterations using L’Ecuyer-CMRG RNG streams[^1].\n\n[^1]: [L’Ecuyer, P. (1999). Good parameters and implementations for combined multiple recursive random number generators. Operations Research, 47, 159–164.](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/opre.47.1.159)\n\nHere are the two equivalent syntaxes:\n\n```{.r}\nset.seed(2)\nresult3 <- foreach(\n  i = 1:1e3,\n  .options.future = list(seed = TRUE),\n  .combine = '+'\n) %dofuture% {\n  runif(3)\n}\n```\n\n```{.r}\nset.seed(2)\nresult3 <- foreach(i = 1:1e3, .combine = '+') %dofuture% {\n  runif(3)\n} %seed% TRUE\n```\n\nOf course remember that we asked Slurm for a single CPU (`--ntasks=1`). So we don't have the hardware to run any code in parallel with our current job.\n\nIt is now time to play with our code with all serial and parallel methods and do some benchmarking.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nWith the overhead of parallelization, it doesn't make sense to parallelize such a fast code: the parallel version will take longer than the serial one.\n\n### Toy example\n\n#### Load packages\n\nFor this toy example, we will use a modified version of one of the examples in the [foreach vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/foreach/vignettes/foreach.html): we will build a classification model made of a forest of decision trees thanks to the [`randomForest`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/index.html) package.\n\n```{.r}\nlibrary(doFuture)       # This automatically loads the foreach and future packages\nlibrary(randomForest)\nlibrary(bench)          # To do some benchmarking\n```\n\n```\nLoading required package: foreach\nLoading required package: future\n```\n\n#### The code to parallelize\n\nThe goal is to create a classifier based on some data (here a matrix of random numbers for simplicity) and a response variable (as factor). This model could then be passed in the `predict()` function with novel data to generate predictions of classification. But here we are only interested in the creation of the model as this is the part that is computationally intensive. We aren't interested in actually using it.\n\n```{.r}\nset.seed(11)\ntraindata <- matrix(runif(1e5), 100)\nfac <- gl(2, 50)\n\nrf <- foreach(ntree = rep(250, 8), .combine = combine) %do%\nrandomForest(x = traindata, y = fac, ntree = ntree)\n\nrf\n```\n\n```\nCall:\nrandomForest(x = traindata, y = fac, ntree = ntree)\nType of random forest: classification\nNumber of trees: 2000\nNo. of variables tried at each split: 31\n```\n\n### Reference timing\n\nThis is the non parallelizable code with `%do%`:\n\n```{.r}\nbm <- mark(\n  rf <- foreach(ntree = rep(250, 8), .combine = combine) %do%\n    randomForest(x = traindata, y = fac, ntree = ntree),\n  memory = FALSE\n)\n\nbm$median\n```\n\n```\n[1] 5.66s\n```\n\n### Plan sequential\n\nThis is the parallelizable `foreach` code, but run sequentially:\n\n```{.r}\nregisterDoFuture()   # Set the parallel backend\nplan(sequential)     # Set the evaluation strategy\n\n# Using bench::mark()\nbm <- mark(\n  rf <- foreach(ntree = rep(250, 8), .combine = combine) %dorng%\n    randomForest(x = traindata, y = fac, ntree = ntree),\n  memory = FALSE\n)\n\nbm$median\n```\n\n```\n[1] 5.78s\n```\n\n:::{.note}\n\nNo surprise: this is similar to the previous timing.\n\n:::\n\n### Multi-processing in shared memory\n\n#### Number of cores\n\n`future` provides `availableCores()` to detect the number of available cores:\n\n```{.r}\navailableCores()\n```\n\n```\ncgroups.cpuset\n             1\n```\n\n:::{.note}\n\nSimilar to `parallel::detectCores()`.\n\n:::\n\nThis detects the number of CPU cores available to us on the current compute node, that is, what we can use for shared memory multi-processing. Since we asked for a single task (`--ntasks=1`) and since by default Slurm grants one CPU per task, we have a single CPU available.\n\nTo be able to run our code in parallel, we need to have access to at least 2 CPUs each. So let's quit the R session (with Ctrl+D or `quit()`—when asked whether to save a workspace image, answer `n`), terminate our interactive job (also with Ctrl+D) and ask for a different job.\n\n:::{.emph}\n\nDon't forget to relinquish your interactive job with Ctrl+D otherwise it will be running for the full 50 min, making the hardware it uses unavailable to all of us until the job expires.\n\n:::\n\nThe cluster for this course is made of 40 nodes with 4 CPUs each. We want to test shared memory parallelism, so our job needs to stay within one node. We can thus ask for a maximum of 4 CPUs and we want to ensure that we aren't getting them on different nodes.\n\nIf we all ask for 4 CPUs in an interactive session, we are fine if there are 40 or fewer of us. If we are too numerous, the first 40 people to ask for an interactive job will get it, but the remainder of us will have their job requests pending, waiting for resources to become available, for as long as the lucky 40 are running their session. That's the big downside of interactive sessions.\n\nA better approach when we need a lot of resource is to write the code in a script and run it with `sbatch`. That way, everybody will get to run their code with minimal delay.\n\nOpen a text file (let's call it `rf.R` since it creates a random forest object) with the text editor of your choice, for instance `nano`:\n\n```{.bash}\nnano rf.R\n```\n\nWe will first play with it to see how many cores are available to us, so write in your script:\n\n```{.r filename=\"rf.R\"}\nlibrary(future)\t  # Don't forget to load the packages in your script\navailableCores()\n```\n\nSave and close the text editor.\n\nNow, we want to create a shell script for Slurm. Let's call it `rf.sh`:\n\n```{.bash}\nnano rf.sh\n```\n\nIn it lives the hardware request and the code that needs to run:\n\n```{.bash filename=\"rf.sh\"}\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --time=10             # 10 min\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=3700M\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4\n\nRscript rf.R                  # This is the code that we are running\n```\n\n:::{.note}\n\nYou can see the full list of `sbatch` options [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html).\n\n:::\n\nSave and close the text editor.\n\nWe can now run the batch script:\n\n```{.bash}\nsbatch rf.sh\n```\n\nYou can monitor it with `sq`, but this should be quasi instant. The result will be written to a file called `slurm-xx.out` with `xx` being the number of the job that just ran.\n\n:::{.note}\n\nYou can specify the output file name in the options of your sbatch script.\n\n:::\n\nTo see the result, we can simply print the content of that file to screen (you can run `ls` to see the list of files in the current directory):\n\n```{.bash}\ncat slurm-xx.out    # Replace xx by the job number\n```\n\n```\nsystem\n     4\n```\n\nWe now have 4 CPUs available on one node, so we can test shared memory parallelism.\n\n#### Plan multisession\n\nShared memory multi-processing can be run with `plan(multisession)` that will spawn new R sessions in the background to evaluate futures.\n\nEdit the R script (with `nano rf.R`):\n\n```{.r filename=\"rf.R\"}\nlibrary(doFuture)\nlibrary(bench)\n\nplan(multisession)\n\nset.seed(2)\n\nxxx\n\nbm$median\n```\n\nRun the job with the new R script:\n\n```{.bash}\nsbatch rf.sh\n```\n\nWe now get in the output file:\n\n```\nLoading required package: foreach\nLoading required package: future\nWarning message:\nSome expressions had a GC in every iteration; so filtering is disabled.\n[1] 3.31s\n```\n\n:::{.note}\n\nWe got a speedup of `11.4 / 3.31 = 3.4`. Not bad considering that we have 4 CPU cores (the ideal speedup would be 4, but there is always some overhead to parallelization).\n\n:::\n\n#### Plan multicore\n\nShared memory multi-processing can also be run with `plan(multicore)` (except on Windows) that will fork the current R process to evaluate futures.\n\nLet's modify our R script again:\n\n```{.r filename=\"rf.R\"}\nlibrary(doFuture)\nlibrary(bench)\n\nplan(multicore)\n\nset.seed(2)\n\nxxx\n\nbm$median\n```\n\nRun the job:\n\n```{.bash}\nsbatch rf.sh\n```\n\nWe get:\n\n```\nLoading required package: foreach\nLoading required package: future\nWarning message:\nSome expressions had a GC in every iteration; so filtering is disabled.\n[1] 1.89s\n```\n\n:::{.note}\n\nWe got a similar speedup of `11.4 / 3.01 = 3.8`. This time we are really close to the ideal speedup of 4!\n\n:::\n\n### Multi-processing in distributed memory\n\n#### Create a cluster of workers\n\nTo test parallel execution in distributed memory, let's ask [Slurm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager) for 8 tasks by editing our `rf.sh` script:\n\n```{.bash filename=\"rf.sh\"}\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --time=10\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=3700M\n#SBATCH --ntasks=8\n\nRscript rf.R      # This is the code that we are running\n```\n\nLet's verify that we do get 8 tasks by accessing the `SLURM_NTASKS` environment variable from within R.\n\nEdit `rf.R` to contain the following:\n\n```{.r filename=\"rf.R\"}\nas.numeric(Sys.getenv(\"SLURM_NTASKS\"))\n```\n\nRun the job:\n\n```{.bash}\nsbatch rf.sh\n```\n\nWe get:\n\n```\n[1] 8\n```\n\nLet's see which nodes we are using:\n\n```{.r filename=\"rf.R\"}\nsystem(\"srun hostname -s\", intern = T)\n```\n\nWe get:\n\n```\n[1] \"node1\" \"node1\" \"node1\" \"node1\" \"node2\" \"node2\" \"node2\" \"node2\"\n```\n\nTo run the RandomForest code with distributed parallelism using 8 CPU cores across both nodes, we will need to create a cluster of workers. We do this with the `makeCluster()` function from the base R `parallel` package: we create a character vector with the names of the nodes our tasks are running on and pass this vector to the `makeCluster()` function:\n\n```{.r}\n## Create a character vector with the nodes names\nhosts <- system(\"srun hostname -s\", intern = T)\n\n## Create the cluster of workers\ncl <- parallel::makeCluster(hosts)\n```\n\nLet's test it:\n\n```{.r filename=\"rf.R\"}\nlibrary(doFuture)\n\nhosts <- system(\"srun hostname -s\", intern = T)\ncl <- parallel::makeCluster(hosts)\n\ncl\n```\n\nIf we run this code, we get:\n\n```\nLoading required package: foreach\nLoading required package: future\nsocket cluster with 8 nodes on hosts ‘node1’, ‘node2’\n```\n\n:::{.note}\n\nMake sure that your code has finished running before printing the output file. Remember that you can monitor the job with `sq`.\n\n:::\n\n#### Plan cluster\n\nWe can now run the code in distributed memory parallelism:\n\n```{.r filename=\"rf.R\"}\nlibrary(doFuture)\nlibrary(bench)\n\nhosts <- system(\"srun hostname -s\", intern = T)\ncl <- parallel::makeCluster(hosts)\nplan(cluster, workers = cl)\n\nset.seed(2)\n\nxxx\n\nbm$median\n```\n\nWe get:\n\n```\nLoading required package: foreach\nLoading required package: future\nWarning message:\nSome expressions had a GC in every iteration; so filtering is disabled.\n[1] 1.94s\n```\n\n:::{.note}\n\nSpeedup: `11.4 / 1.94 = 5.9`. Here again, this is not bad with 8 CPU cores, considering the added overhead of message passing between both nodes.\n\n:::\n\nThe cluster of workers can be stopped with:\n\n```{.r}\nparallel::stopCluster(cl)\n```\n\nHere, this is not necessary since our job stops running as soon as the execution is complete, but in other systems, this will prevent you from monopolizing hardware unnecessarily.\n",
