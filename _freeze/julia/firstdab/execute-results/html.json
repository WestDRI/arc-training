People often say that using Julia feels like running R or python with a speed *almost* comparable to that of C.\n\nBut Julia also comes with parallel computing and multi-threading capabilities.\n\nIn this webinar, after a quickly presentation of some of the key features of Julia's beautifully concise syntax, I will dive into using Julia for HPC.\n\n:::\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQsxn8OUXGA >}}\n\n",
