[NABirds dataset](https://dl.allaboutbirds.org/nabirds) from the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/)

48,562 images of 404 bird species
Many of these species are further subdivided into categories such as Male/Female, Adult/Juvenile, Breeding/Non-breeding, which leads to 555 total classes


[UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)

The data is roughly evenly split between training and validation (23,929 training and 24,633 validation). The number of training images per class is quite variable, with 60 images for about a quarter of classes, and single digits for some of the rarer varieties (4 for the white winged dark-eyed junco and 5 for the female harlequin duck.)
