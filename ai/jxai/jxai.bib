  ABSTRACT =	 {Data augmentation is a fundamental technique in
                  machine learning that plays a crucial role in
                  expanding the size of training datasets. By applying
                  various transformations or modifications to existing
                  data, data augmentation enhances the generalization
                  and robustness of machine learning models. In recent
                  years, the development of several libraries has
                  simplified the utilization of diverse data
                  augmentation strategies across different tasks. This
                  paper focuses on the exploration of the most widely
                  adopted libraries specifically designed for data
                  augmentation in computer vision tasks. Here, we aim
                  to provide a comprehensive survey of publicly
                  available data augmentation libraries, facilitating
                  practitioners to navigate these resources
                  effectively. Through a curated taxonomy, we present
                  an organized classification of the different
                  approaches employed by these libraries, along with
                  accompanying application examples. By examining the
                  techniques of each library, practitioners can make
                  informed decisions in selecting the most suitable
                  augmentation techniques for their computer vision
                  projects. To ensure the accessibility of this
                  valuable information, a dedicated public website
                  named DALib has been created. This website serves as
                  a centralized repository where the taxonomy,
                  methods, and examples associated with the surveyed
                  data augmentation libraries can be explored. By
                  offering this comprehensive resource, we aim to
                  empower practitioners and contribute to the
                  advancement of computer vision research and
                  applications through effective utilization of data
                  augmentation techniques.},
