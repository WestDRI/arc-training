## What is data augmentation?

Training deep learning models requires vast amounts of labelled data. The more diverse and numerous the data, the better the models will perform on new, unseen data.

A number of labelled datasets exist, but they are only so big. Moreover, for specific applications, you will need to fine-tune models on specific data for which there might not be any labelled data. And labelling data is costly and time-consuming. In some cases, it might even be impossible because little unlabelled data exist (think for instance of rare tumours).

Data augmentation is the artificial creation of new data by modifying the existing data in small ways. It is very powerful to avoid overfitting, particularly where datasets are small (if you were lucky enough to have a huge dataset, you wouldn't need to bother with data augmentation which would actually create an additional computationally costly step with extremely little benefit).

## Tools

[PIX](https://github.com/google-deepmind/dm_pixk) provides low-level, JAX-native image processing primitives that can be directly jitted and vmapped.

[TorchVision transforms](https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/0.8/transforms.html)

[skimage.transform](https://scikit-image.org/docs/0.25.x/api/skimage.transform.html) from [scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image) (that we used previously to create a Transform that resizes our images with padding).

:::{.emph}

We are shifting paradigm here and moving from the CPU to the GPU. This is where JAX comes in.

:::

## Techniques

- Geometric transformations (flips, rotations, scaling, crops...)
- Color space transformations (brightness, contrast, gamma, hue, saturation, grayscale conversion, channel shuffling...)
- Noise transformations (Gaussian noise, blurring...)
- Occlusive transformations (erasing parts of the image)
- Mixing images (various techniques mixing images and appropriately applying the same treatment to labels)

## Choosing the techniques

### How many to use?

The size of your dataset dictates how aggressively you should augment.

| Dataset Size | Strategy | Recommended Count |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tiny (<1k images)** | **Heavy Augmentation.** You should be worried about overfitting, so you need to create more artificial data | **4-6 techniques.** Use strong geometric shifts  |
| **Medium (1k - 50k)** | **Standard Augmentation.** Balance variety with training speed | **3-4 techniques.** |
| **Massive (>1M images)** | **Light Augmentation.** The data itself already provides diversity. Augmentation will only slow down training. | **1-2 techniques.**  |

### Which ones to use?

The choice depends on the problem.

In our case, we are dealing with fine-grained birds identification. Colours are critical for species differentiation, so we don't want to mess with that. So playing with hue or solarization would be a bad idea as it might invalidate the labels (making one species actually look like another). Vertical flips or 90° rotations would not be great either as they wouldn't produce realistic data...

The most important techniques in this case are geometric augmentation ones such as random crops, horizontal flips, and slight rotations.

We can also do some photometric augmentation as long as they don't invalidate the labels: brightness and contrast. If we want the model to be able to identify black and white pictures, we definitely need to remove the colour dependence by using a technique turning images to gray (with some probability and level of colour removal). If, on the other hand, we are only interested in having a model able to identify colour images, we want to stay away from this.

### How to combine them?



### Choosing their parameters

Picking the right bounds for each type of data augmentation involves balancing dataset diversity against image realism. If the range is too narrow, you don't get much benefit, if it's too wide, you might destroy critical features or create unrealistic images that confuse the model.

#### Default range

Check the industry-standards (look at the literature, ask an LLM, etc.).

:::{.notenoline}

Example for gamma:

For most computer vision tasks (natural images, object detection, classification), the industry-standard starting point is 0.8 to 1.2.

This range simulates subtle lighting variations—like a cloud passing over the sun or a slight difference in camera exposure—without washing out the image or making it too dark to see details.

:::

#### Domain specific ranges

You might want to adjust the values based on your specific data type.

:::{.notenoline}

Example for gamma:

You can increase the range for OCR (document analysis) because scanned documents often have wildly varying contrast and because text usually remains legible even under extreme gamma.

:::

#### Visual sanity check

Never set augmentation parameters blindly. Visualize some tests to ensure the data you are using to train is still reasonable (and to make sure that you aren't messing something up and getting totally absurd results!).

#### Validation check

adjust their probabilities or magnitudes based on validation performance.

Train a small version of your model (or for fewer epochs) and check whether the validation loss improves with data augmentation compared to no augmentation.

Load packages:

```{python}
import dm_pix as pix
import PIL.Image as Image
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import jax.numpy as jnp
```

```{python}
def apply_gamma(img, gamma):
    """xxx"""
    new_img = pix.adjust_gamma(
        image=img,
        gamma=gamma
    )
    pil_img = Image.fromarray(
        np.asarray(new_img * 255.).astype(np.uint8), 'RGB'
    )
    gamma = round(gamma, 1)
    return pil_img, gamma
```



```{python}
def show_tests(img, gamma_range):
    jnp_img = jnp.array(img, dtype=jnp.float32) / 255.
    pics = []
    gammas = []

    for i in gamma_range:
        pics.append(apply_gamma(jnp_img, i)[0])
        gammas.append(apply_gamma(jnp_img, i)[1])

    fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 4, figsize=(8, 6))
    axes = axes.flatten()

    for i, ax in enumerate(axes):
        ax.imshow(pics[i])
        ax.axis('off')
        ax.set_title(f'Gamma = {gammas[i]}', fontsize=9)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```

Now we can apply it to a few images to get an idea of the effect and ensure nothing weird is going on. This will help us catch a coding mistake that could ruin the whole training process:

```{python}
show_tests(nabirds_train[0]['image'], np.linspace(0.1, 3, 12))
show_tests(nabirds_train[1]['image'], np.linspace(0.1, 3, 12))
show_tests(nabirds_train[2]['image'], np.linspace(0.1, 3, 12))
show_tests(nabirds_train[3]['image'], np.linspace(0.1, 3, 12))
```

Let's use [random gamma](https://dm-pix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#random-gamma) with the min and max values at 0.6 and 1.3 respectively.
