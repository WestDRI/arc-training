:::{.def}

In this section, we process some of the metadata associated with the NABirds dataset by creating a [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) DataFrame collecting all the information we will need while processing the images and training our model. This allows us to get some information about the dataset.

*[Polars](/python/hpc_polars) is a modern and ultra fast package that you should use instead of [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) whenever you can if you care about performance.*

:::

## Metadata files

In addition to images, the dataset comes with a number of text files. To understand the dataset, of course, the place start is by reading ... the README.

### The nabirds dataset

#### Versions

v0 - June 2015: initial release

For more information about the dataset, visit the project websites:

  http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia
  http://vision.cornell.edu/se3/projects/visipedia/
  http://dl.allaboutbirds.org/nabirds

If you use the dataset in a publication, please cite the dataset in the style described on the dataset website (see url above).

Please see the nabirds.py file for example code on using the data. You can visualize images and annotations by running: python nabirds.py
Make sure you are in the nabirds/ directory.

#### Directory information

- images/

	The images organized in subdirectories based on species. See IMAGES AND CLASS LABELS section below for more info.

- parts/

	11 part locations per image. See PART LOCATIONS section below for more info.

### Images and class labels

Images are contained in the directory images/, with 555 subdirectories (one for each bird category).

#### List of image files (images.txt)

The list of image file names is contained in the file images.txt, with each line corresponding to one image:

<image_id> <image_name>

#### Train/test split (train_test_split.txt)

The suggested train/test split is contained in the file train_test_split.txt, with each line corresponding to one image:

<image_id> <is_training_image>

where <image_id> corresponds to the ID in images.txt, and a value of 1 or 0 for <is_training_image> denotes that the file is in the training or test set, respectively.

#### Image sizes (sizes.txt)

The size of each image in pixels:

<image_id> <width> <height>

where <image_id> corresponds to the ID in images.txt, and <width> and <height> correspond to the width and height of the image in pixels.

#### Image photographers (photographers.txt)

The photographer for each image:

<image_id> <photographer_name>

where <image_id> corresponds to the ID in images.txt, and <photographer_name> corresponds to the name of the photographer that took the photo. Please
be considerate and display the photographer's name when displaying their image.

#### List of class names (classes.txt)

The list of class names (bird species) is contained in the file classes.txt, with each line corresponding to one class:

<class_id> <class_name>

#### Image class labels (image_class_labels.txt)

The ground truth class labels (bird species labels) for each image are contained in the file image_class_labels.txt, with each line corresponding to one image:

<image_id> <class_id>

where <image_id> and <class_id> correspond to the IDs in images.txt and classes.txt, respectively.

#### Class hierarchy (hierarchy.txt)

The ground truth class labels (bird species labels) for each image are contained in the file image_class_labels.txt, with each line corresponding to one image:

<child_class_id> <parent_class_id>

where <child_class_id> and <parent_class_id> correspond to the IDs in classes.txt.

### Bounding boxes

Each image contains a single bounding box label.  Bounding box labels are contained in the file bounding_boxes.txt, with each line corresponding to one image:

<image_id> <x> <y> <width> <height>

where <image_id> corresponds to the ID in images.txt, and <x>, <y>, <width>, and <height> are all measured in pixels.

### Part locations

#### List of part names (parts/parts.txt)

The list of all part names is contained in the file parts/parts.txt, with each line corresponding to one part:

<part_id> <part_name>

#### Part locations (parts/part_locs.txt)

The set of all ground truth part locations is contained in the file parts/part_locs.txt, with each line corresponding to the annotation of a particular part in a particular image:

<image_id> <part_id> <x> <y> <visible>

where <image_id> and <part_id> correspond to the IDs in images.txt and parts/parts.txt, respectively.  <x> and <y> denote the pixel location of the center of the part.  <visible> is 0 if the part is not visible in the image and 1 otherwise.

:::

Each image is associated with a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

We won't need all the information provided with this dataset for this course, but what we need is contained in the following files:

Name | Content
---| -------
bounding_boxes.txt | List of UUIDs and their corresponding bounding boxes (one bounding box per image, just around the bird)
classes.txt | List of class ids and corresponding class names
image_class_labels.txt | List of UUIDs and their corresponding class ids
images.txt | List of UUIDs and their corresponding file names
photographers.txt | List of UUIDs and their corresponding photographers
train_test_split.txt | List of UUIDs and 1 or 0 depending on whether the image is for training or validation respectively (the dataset comes with a suggested split)

## Clean problem files

Two of the files are problematic because they are jagged: the number of elements per line is inconsistent.

Let's create a cleaning function that writes cleaned up copies of the files:

```{python}
def clean_file(input_filepath, output_filepath):
    """
    Remove commas, remove quotes, and replace all spaces except the first space
    on each line with underscores.

    Args:
        input_filepath (str): the path of the input file.
        output_filepath (str): the path of the output file.
    """
    with open(input_filepath, 'r') as infile, \
         open(output_filepath, 'w') as outfile:

        for line in infile:
            # Remove quotes and commas
            cleaned_line = line.replace('"', '').replace(',', '')

            # Strip newline characters
            cleaned_line = cleaned_line.strip()

            # Split line into two parts based on the first space
            parts = cleaned_line.split(' ', 1)

            # Replace spaces in the second part with underscores
            part2_cleaned = parts[1].replace(' ', '_')

            final_line = f"{parts[0]} {part2_cleaned}\n"

            outfile.write(final_line)
```

Then we can apply the function on our files:

```{.python}
base_dir = "<path-of-the-nabirds-dir>"
```

:::{.note}

To be replaced by proper path.

:::

```{python}
#| echo: false

base_dir = "nabirds"
```

```{python}
import os

clean_file(
    os.path.join(base_dir, "photographers.txt"),
    os.path.join(base_dir, "photographers_cleaned.txt")
)

clean_file(
    os.path.join(base_dir, "classes.txt"),
    os.path.join(base_dir, "classes_cleaned.txt")
)
```

## Create variables

For convenience, let's create variables with the path of the various files we need:

```{python}
bb_file = os.path.join(base_dir, "bounding_boxes.txt")
class_id_to_name_file = os.path.join(base_dir, "classes_cleaned.txt")
class_id_file = os.path.join(base_dir, "image_class_labels.txt")
path_file = os.path.join(base_dir, "images.txt")
photographer_file = os.path.join(base_dir, "photographers_cleaned.txt")
train_test_split_file = os.path.join(base_dir, "train_test_split.txt")
```

## Create a metadata DataFrame

Now it's time to put all the data together in one DataFrame.

First, we create a series of DataFrames from each text file:

```{python}
import polars as pl

bb = pl.read_csv(
    bb_file,
    separator=" ",
    has_header=False,
    new_columns=["UUID", "bb_x", "bb_y", "bb_width", "bb_height"]
)

class_id = pl.read_csv(
    class_id_file,
    separator=" ",
    has_header=False,
    new_columns=["UUID", "class_id"]
)

class_id_to_name = pl.read_csv(
    class_id_to_name_file,
    separator=" ",
    has_header=False,
    new_columns=["class_id", "class_name"]
)

path = pl.read_csv(
    path_file,
    separator=" ",
    has_header=False,
    new_columns=["UUID", "path"]
)

photographer = pl.read_csv(
    photographer_file,
    separator=" ",
    has_header=False,
    new_columns=["UUID", "photographer"]
)

train_test_split = pl.read_csv(
    train_test_split_file,
    separator=" ",
    has_header=False,
    new_columns=["UUID", "is_training_img"]
)
```

:::{.note}

We can use `polars.read_csv` even though we have text files because our files are space separated value files. So they function like CSV files with the exception that we have to set the value of the `separator` argument to ` `.

:::

Then we can combine the two DataFrames dealing with classes so that the birds identifications becomes directly associated with the birds UUIDs:

```{python}
classes_metadata = (
    class_id.join(class_id_to_name, on="class_id")
)
```

Finally, we combine all the DataFrames:

```{python}
metadata = (
    bb.join(classes_metadata, on="UUID")
    .join(path, on="UUID")
    .join(photographer, on="UUID")
    .join(train_test_split, on="UUID")
)
```

## Sanity checks

Let's see what our DataFrame looks like:

```{python}
print(metadata)
```

And then let's explore a number of characteristics:

```{python}
print(metadata.columns)
print(metadata.row(0))
print(metadata.row(-1))
```

```{python}
print(metadata.head())
```

```{python}
print(metadata.tail())
```

```{python}
import random

random.seed(123)
print(metadata.sample())
```

```{python}
print(metadata.schema)
print(metadata.shape)
```

```{python}
print(metadata.glimpse())
```

```{python}
print(metadata.describe())
```

## Learn about the data

Now that we have the metadata organized, let's get to know our data:

```{python}
print(f'There are {len(metadata)} images in the dataset.')
```

```{python}
training_set = metadata.filter(pl.col("is_training_img") == 1)
print(f'There are {len(training_set)} images in the training set and {len(metadata) - len(training_set)} in the evaluation set.')
```

```{python}
class_id = metadata.group_by(pl.col("class_id")).len()
print(f'There are {len(class_id)} different classes.')
```

```{python}
metadata.filter(pl.col("class_name"
```

## Save DataFrame to Parquet

To make it easier to retrieve information from the metadata later on, we can save the DataFrame to file.

[Parquet](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/) is an open-source, columnar, and extremely efficient binary file format for tabular data. Unlike in CSV or JSON files, the data is compressed, making it efficient for storage space. It is also excellent for query performance. Always prefer it over text-based formats.

```{python}
metadata.write_parquet("metadata.parquet")
```

Our metadata is ready. We can now start working with the pictures.
