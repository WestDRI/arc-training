## The Linen API

In Flax, the base class for neural networks is the [flax.linen.Module](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.linen/module.html). Linen is a new API replacing the initial `flax.nn` API and taking full advantage of JAX transformations while automating the initialization and handling of the parameters.

Linen is imported this way:

```{.python}
from flax import linen as nn
```

To define a model, you create a subclass. The syntax closely resembles that of PyTorch `torch.nn`:

```{.python}
class Net(nn.Module):
    ...
```

But unlike in PyTorch, the parameters are passed through the model in the form of [Pytrees](https://mint.westdri.ca/ai/jx_pytree) (nested containers such as dictionaries, lists, and tuples).
