## What is machine learning?

*Artificial intelligence* is a vast field: any system mimicking animal intelligence falls in its scope.

*Machine learning* (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that can be defined as computer programs whose performance at a task improves with experience.

Since this experience comes in the form of *data*, ML consists of feeding vast amounts of data to algorithms to strengthen *pathways*.

### Example in image recognition

Coding all the possible ways—pixel by pixel—that a picture can represent a certain object is an impossibly large task. By feeding examples of images of that object to a neural network however, we can train it to recognize that object in images that it has never seen (without explicitly programming how it does this!).

## Types of learning

There are now more types of learning than those presented here. But these initial types are interesting because they will already be familiar to you.

### Supervised learning

You have been doing supervised machine learning for years without looking at it in the framework of machine learning:

- *Regression* is a form of supervised learning with continuous outputs
- *Classification* is supervised learning with discrete outputs

Supervised learning uses training data in the form of example input/output $(x_i, y_i)$ pairs.

***Goal:***

If $X$ is the space of inputs and $Y$ the space of outputs, the goal is to find a function $h$ so that\
for each $x_i \in X$:

- $h_\theta(x_i)$ is a predictor for the corresponding value $y_i$ \
- ($\theta$ represents the set of parameters of $h_\theta$).

→ i.e. we want to find the relationship between inputs and outputs.

### Unsupervised learning

Here too, you are familiar with some forms of unsupervised learning that you weren't thinking about in such terms:

Clustering, social network analysis, market segmentation, PCA ... are all forms of unsupervised learning.

Unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data (training set of $x_i$).

***Goal:***

Find structure within the data.

## Artificial neural networks

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are one of the machine learning models (other models include decision trees or Bayesian networks). Their potential and popularity has truly exploded in recent years and this is what we will focus on in this course.

Artificial neural networks are a series of layered units mimicking the concept of biological neurons: inputs are received by every unit of a layer, computed, then transmitted to units of the next layer. In the process of learning, experience strengthens some connections between units and weakens others.

In biological networks, the information consists of action potentials (neuron membrane rapid depolarizations) propagating through the network. In artificial ones, the information consists of tensors (multidimensional arrays) of weights and biases: each unit passes a weighted sum of an input tensor with an additional—possibly weighted—bias through an activation function before passing on the output tensor to the next layer of units.\

:::{.note}

The bias allows to shift the output of the activation function to the right or to the left (i.e. it creates an offset).

:::

While biological neurons are connected in extremely intricate patterns, artificial ones follow a layered structure. Another difference in complexity is in the number of units: the human brain has 65–90 billion neurons. ANN have much fewer units.

:::

The information in biological neurons is an all-or-nothing electrochemical pulse or action potential. Greater stimuli don’t produce stronger signals but increase firing frequency. In contrast, artificial neurons pass the computation of their inputs through an activation function and the output can take any of the values possible with that function.

:::

Which activation function to use depends on the type of problem and the available computing budget. Some early functions have fallen out of use while new ones have emerged (e.g. sigmoid got replaced by ReLU which is easier to train).

#### Learning

The process of learning in biological NN happens through neuron death or growth and through the creation or loss of synaptic connections between neurons. In ANN, learning happens through optimization algorithms such as gradient descent which minimize cross entropy loss functions by adjusting the weights and biases connecting each layer of neurons over many iterations (cross entropy is the difference between the predicted and the real distributions).

#### Gradient descent

There are several gradient descent methods:

*Batch gradient descent* uses all examples in each iteration and is thus slow for large datasets (the parameters are adjusted only after all the samples have been processed).

*Mini-batch gradient descent* is an intermediate approach: it uses mini-batch sized examples in each iteration. This allows a vectorized approach (and hence parallelization).\
The [Adam optimization algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) is a popular variation of mini-batch gradient descent.

*Stochastic gradient descent* uses one example in each iteration. It is thus much faster than batch gradient descent (the parameters are adjusted after each example). But it does not allow any vectorization.

#### [3Blue1Brown by Grant Sanderson](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) videos

[3Blue1Brown by Grant Sanderson](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) has a series of 4 videos on neural networks which is easy to watch, fun, and does an excellent job at introducing the functioning of a simple neural network.

##### What are NN? (19 min)

As you develop your own ML models, if you find that your mathematical background is shaky, 3blue1brown also has [an excellent series of videos on linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) and [an equally great one on calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr).

There is one minor terminological error in this video: they call the use of mini-batches *stochastic gradient descent*. In fact, this is called *mini-batch gradient descent*. Stochastic gradient descent uses a single example at each iteration.

Each neuron receives inputs from every neuron of the previous layer and passes its output to every neuron of the next layer.

#### Convolutional neural networks

:::

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used for spatially structured data (e.g. in image recognition).

Images have huge input sizes and would require a very large number of neurons in a fully connected neural net. In convolutional layers, neurons receive input from a subarea (called *local receptive field*) of the previous layer. This greatly reduces the number of parameters.

Optionally, pooling (combining the outputs of neurons in a subarea) reduces the data dimensions. The *stride* then dictates how the subarea is moved across the image. *Max-pooling* is one of the forms of pooling which uses the maximum for each subarea.

#### Recurrent neural networks

![](../img/rnn.png){fig-alt="noshadow"}

:::{.caption}

From [fdeloche, Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Recurrent_neural_network_unfold.svg)

:::

Recurrent neural networks (RNN) such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are used for chain structured data (e.g. in speech recognition).

They are not feedforward networks (i.e. networks for which the information moves only in the forward direction without any loop).

#### Transformers

A combination of two RNNs or sets of RNNs (the *encoder* and the *decoder*) is used in sequence to sequence models for translation or picture captioning. Such models were slow to process a lot of data.

In 2014 and 2015, the concept of *attention* (giving added weight to important words) was developed, greatly improving the ability of such models to process a lot of data.

[This blog post](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/) by [Jay Alammar](http://jalammar.github.io/about/)—a blogger whose high-quality posts have been referenced in MIT and Stanford courses—explains this in a high-level visual fashion.

The problem with recurrence is that it is not easily to parallelize (and thus to run fast on GPUs).

In 2017, a new model—the [transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)—was proposed: by using only attention mechanisms and no recurrence, the transformer achieves better results in an easily parallelizable fashion.

Jay Alammar has also [a blog post on the transformer](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/). The post includes a 30 min video.

With the addition of transfer learning, powerful transformers emerged in the field of [NLP (Natural Language Processing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing). Examples include [BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) from Google and [GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165) from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).

Jay Alammar has yet another great [blog post](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/) on these advanced NLP models.

### Deep learning

The first layer of a neural net is the *input layer*. The last one is the *output layer*. All the layers in-between are called *hidden layers*. Shallow neural networks have only one hidden layer and deep networks have two or more hidden layers. When an ANN is deep, we talk about *Deep Learning* (DL).
