Faster than [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/) is the new open source Google framework for high-performance array computations and differentiation. With a [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)-like API, it uses [asynchronous dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)), [just-in-time compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation), and the [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla) compiler for linear algebra to run on accelerators ([GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) and [TPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit)).

This course will introduce the basics of JAX functioning—its strengths and its constraints.
