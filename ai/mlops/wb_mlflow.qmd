:::{.def}

[MLflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow) is a free, open-source, and popular platform for the development and deployment of machine learning and deep learning models. It tracks experiments, logs training statistics and displays them in an interactive user interface (UI), saves models and provides tools to deploy them.

Because MLflow can be combined with any ML or DL framework, work with any hyperparameter optimization tool, and run a server anywhere, it is very flexible.
