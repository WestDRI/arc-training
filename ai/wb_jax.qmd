title: "JAX: a framework for high-performance array computing"

:::{.def}

[JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/) is an open source framework by Google for high-performance array computations and differentiation. With a [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)-like API, it uses [asynchronous dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)), [just-in-time compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation), and the [XLA compiler for linear algebra](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla) to run on accelerators ([GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) and [TPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit)). It is both very fast and flexible. This however comes at the cost of some constraints: JAX requires pure functional programming code.

This webinar will introduce JAX's principles and functioning.
