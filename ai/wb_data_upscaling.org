*** /Abstract/

- Alex Razoumov
In the next couple of days I am planning to go through everything you showed in your
    webinar, and check how I can set up training with my own data.
And we need to write an abstract.
Here is my plan:
• add training on our own image data (not just using pre-trained models)
• do this training on a cluster
• apply training to binary (non-image) data
• check how this compares to other approaches, e.g. the astrophysics paper
    https://www.pnas.org/content/118/19/e2022038118

- Alex Razoumov
Images: easy to generate our own programmatically with basic shapes, and then reduce
    resolution. Or maybe pull something public-domaion from the web? For non-image: I
    probably have archived galaxy formation simulation data. Or maybe something from
    one of the IEEE Contests. I have no code to share yet.

Images: we could use one of the classic datasets that everybody uses for image
    superresolution
I reference several in my talk

Super-resolution—the process of (re)creating high resolution images from low resolution ones—is an old field, but deep neural networks have seen a sudden surge of new and very impressive methods over the past 10 years, from SRCCN to SRGAN to Transformers.

In this webinar, I will give a quick overview of these methods and show how the latest state-of-the-art model—[[https://github.com/jingyunliang/swinir][SwinIR]]—performs on a few test images. We will use [[https://pytorch.org/][PyTorch]] as our framework.
