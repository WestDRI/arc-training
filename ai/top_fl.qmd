Domain specific libraries have been developed on top of JAX to take advantage of its high-performance computations of multidimensional arrays and/or its autodiff abilities.

This course is an introduction to deep learning with JAX using the [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) neural networks library in combination with [Optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It assumes [basic understanding of the functioning of JAX](https://mint.westdri.ca/ai/top_jx).
