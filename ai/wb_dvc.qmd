:::{.def}

[Data version control (DVC)](https://dvc.org/) is an open source tool that brings all the versioning and collaboration capabilities you use on your code with Git to your data and deep learning models. It makes it easy to track the evolution of your datasets and models, manage your pipelines from parameters to metrics, collaborate on your machine learning experiments, and integrate with [continuous machine learning CI/CD](https://cml.dev/).

This webinar will show you how to get started with DVC, whether you simply want to keep track of the evolution of your data, or whether you want to manage your machine learning workflow in a more organized and reproducible fashion.
