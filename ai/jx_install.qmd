title: Installing JAX

:::{.def}

In this section, we will access a virtual training cluster through SSH and make JAX accessible.

We will also cover how to install JAX in the Alliance production clusters.

:::

Unless you aren't planning to use accelerators, JAX relies on GPUs/TPUs dependencies determined by your OS and hardware (e.g. CUDA and CUDNN). Making sure that the dependencies are installed, compatible, and working with JAX can be finicky, so it is **a lot easier** to install JAX from pip wheels.

## On your computer

On your personal computer, use the wheel installation command [from the official JAX site](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) corresponding to your system.

:::{.note}

On Windows, GPUs are only supported via [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) 2.

:::

Because JAX is designed for large array computations and machine learning, you will most likely want to use it on supercomputers. In this course, we will thus use a virtual Alliance cluster.

## On an Alliance cluster

:::{.note}

The virtual clusters we create for teaching mimic the Alliance clusters pretty well, but there are a few minor differences. We also already created a Python virtual environment with JAX installed to save time. The instructions for today thus differ a little from what you would normally do. Both are explained in separate tabs where they differ.

### Logging in through SSH

#### Open a terminal emulator

Windows users: &emsp;Install the free version of [MobaXTerm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html) and launch it. \
MacOS users: &emsp;&emsp;Launch Terminal. \
Linux users: &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;Open the terminal emulator of your choice.

#### Access the cluster through secure shell

##### Windows users

Follow the first 18% of [this demo](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/demo.html).

For "Remote host", use the hostname we gave you. \
Select the box "Specify username" and provide your username.

:::{.note}

Note that the password is entered through blind typing, meaning that you will not see anything happening as you type it. This is a Linux feature. While it is a little disturbing at first, do know that it is working. Make sure to type it slowly to avoid typos, then press the "enter" key on your keyboard.

:::

##### MacOS and Linux users

In the terminal, run:

```{.bash}
ssh <username>@<hostname>
```

:::{.note}

Replace the username and hostname by their values.<br>
For instance:

```{.bash}
ssh user21@somecluster.c3.ca
```

:::

You will be asked a question, answer "Yes".

When prompted, type the password.

#### Troubleshooting

Problems logging in are almost always due to typos. If you cannot log in, retry slowly, entering your password carefully.

### Install JAX

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Today

I already created a virtual Python environment under `/project` and installed JAX in it to save time and space. All you have to do is activate it:

```{.bash}
source /project/60055/env/bin/activate
```

#### Production cluster

Look for available Python modules:

```{.bash}
module spider python
```

Load the version of your choice:

```{.bash}
module load python/3.11.5
```

Create a Python virtual environment:

```{.bash}
python -m venv ~/env
```

Activate it:

```{.bash}
source ~/env/bin/activate
```

Update pip from wheel:

```{.bash}
python -m pip install --upgrade pip --no-index
```

:::{.note}

Whenever a [Python wheel](https://pythonwheels.com/) for a package is available on the Alliance clusters, you should use it instead of downloading the package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). To do this, simply add the `--no-index` flag to the install command.

You can see whether a wheel is available with `avail_wheels <package>` or look at [the list of available wheels](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Available_Python_wheels).

Advantages of wheels:

- compiled for the clusters hardware,
- ensures no missing or conflicting dependencies,
- much faster installation.

:::

Install JAX from wheel:

```{.bash}
python -m pip install jax --no-index
```

:::{.note}

Don't forget the `--no-index` flag here: the wheel will save you from having to deal with the CUDA and CUDNN dependencies, making your life a lot easier.
