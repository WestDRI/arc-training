In this section, we will make sure that you can access Emacs on our remote cluster.

:::

## Installing Emacs on your machine

To download and install Emacs on your computer, [simply follow the instructions in the official documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html).

## Accessing Emacs on the Alliance clusters

To ensure that we are all working in the same environment, for this course, we will use Emacs in a training cluster. This will also prepare you for using it on the Alliance clusters.

### Log in through SSH

#### Open a terminal emulator

Windows users: &emsp;Install the free version of [MobaXTerm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html) and launch it. \
MacOS users: &emsp;&emsp;Launch Terminal. \
Linux users: &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;Open the terminal emulator of your choice.

#### Access the cluster through secure shell

##### Windows users

Follow the first 18% of [this demo](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/demo.html).

For "Remote host", use the hostname we gave you. \
Select the box "Specify username" and provide your username.

:::{.note}

Note that the password is entered through blind typing, meaning that you will not see anything happening as you type it. This is a Linux feature. While it is a little disturbing at first, do know that it is working. Make sure to type it slowly to avoid typos, then press the "enter" key on your keyboard.

:::

##### MacOS and Linux users

In the terminal, run:

```{.bash}
ssh <username>@<hostname>
```

:::{.note}

Replace the username and hostname by their values.<br>
For instance:

```{.bash}
ssh user21@somecluster.c3.ca
```

:::

You will be asked a question, answer "Yes".

When prompted, type the password.

#### Troubleshooting

Problems logging in are almost always due to typos. If you cannot log in, retry slowly, entering your password carefully.

### Launch Emacs

There is no need to load any module to access Emacs on the clusters. To launch Emacs, simply run:

```{.bash}
emacs
```
