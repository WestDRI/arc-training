:::{.def}

[Large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) have become powerful tools for coding,writing, and research. Not surprisingly, they are increasingly becoming integrated into many software.

For the Emacs users out there, I will show you how to use the latest OpenAI model via [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) from within Emacs for code completion (thanks to [copilot.el](https://github.com/copilot-emacs/copilot.el)) and for chatting, code review, code correction, code optimization, code transformation, and code explanation (thanks to [copilot-chat.el](https://github.com/chep/copilot-chat.el)).

Then I will show how to use any number of models in Emacs with [gptel](https://github.com/karthink/gptel).
