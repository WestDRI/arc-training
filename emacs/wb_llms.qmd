:::{.def}

[Large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) have become powerful tools for coding, writing, and research. Not surprisingly, they are increasingly becoming integrated into many software, including text editors.

Emacs is no exception and a number of packages have recently been developed to access models smoothly and directly. Of particular notice:

- [copilot.el](https://github.com/copilot-emacs/copilot.el) brings [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)'s code completion to Emacs,
- [copilot-chat.el](https://github.com/chep/copilot-chat.el) allows to chat, write tests, explain, document, review, correct, and optimize code with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) in Emacs,
- [gptel](https://github.com/karthink/gptel) allows access to LLMs from any buffer,
- [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) provides an Emacs shell to chat with LLMs,
- [mcp.el](https://github.com/lizqwerscott/mcp.el) provides an Emacs client for [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/),
- [aidermacs](https://github.com/MatthewZMD/aidermacs) brings [aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) to Emacs (so forget about Cursor ðŸ™‚).

In this webinar, I will demo these packages and show you how to install them and set things up.

Info on [mcp.el](https://github.com/lizqwerscott/mcp.el) and its integration with [gptel](https://github.com/karthink/gptel) and [copilot-chat.el](https://github.com/chep/copilot-chat.el) was added after the webinar, so it is in the slides, but not in the video.
