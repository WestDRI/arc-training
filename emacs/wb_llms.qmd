:::{.def}

[Large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) have become powerful tools for coding, writing, and research. Not surprisingly, they are increasingly becoming integrated into many software, including text editors.

Emacs is no exception and a number of packages have recently been developed to access models smoothly and directly. Of particular notice:

- [copilot.el](https://github.com/copilot-emacs/copilot.el) brings [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)'s code completion to Emacs,
- [copilot-chat.el](https://github.com/chep/copilot-chat.el) allows to chat, perform code review, code correction, code optimization, code transformation, and code explanation with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) in Emacs,
- [gptel](https://github.com/karthink/gptel) allows access to any LLM from any buffer,
- [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) provides an Emacs shell to chat with any LLM.

In this webinar, I will demo these packages and show you how to install them and set things up.
