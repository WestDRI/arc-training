## A few Emacs concepts

### Emacs Lisp

[Emacs Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp) is a dialect of the [Lisp programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) developed especially to write the editing functionality of the Emacs text editor (the rest of Emacs and its interpreter are written in C)

Emacs is endlessly customizable to anyone with a basic knowledge of Emacs Lisp. In particular,  [variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Variables.html) and [functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Functions.html) setting the behaviour and appearance of the text editor can be created or modified

The language is [well documented](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/)

### Graphical display

### Keybindings (kbd)

![From [Ecol LG #134](http://linuxgazette.net/134/ecol.html) by [Javier Malonda](https://linuxgazette.net/authors/malonda.html)](img/kbd.png){fig-align="center"}

### Kbd notations

`C-c` means press the **Control** key and the **C** key together

`M-x` means press the **Alt** (Windows) or **Option** (macOS) key and the **X** key together

`C-c m` means press the **Control** key and the **C** key together, then press the **M** key

`C-c C-x m` means press **Ctl+C**, then **Ctl+X**, then **M**

`C-x C-c M-w C-m M-v M-t M-u` means that you probably should choose another kbd

### Command execution

A useful way to execute a command interactively, when it is not bound to a kbd, is to type `M-x` (this brings up the *minibuffer*, a place in which to type inputs) followed by the command name

:::{.example}

For example, `M-x count-words` will output the number of lines, sentences, words, and characters of the current buffer in the echo area

## Time to talk about Emacs modes

### Major modes

Different types of text require different behaviours, syntax highlighting, formatting, functions, variables, etc.

Each type of buffer (e.g. Python script, Markdown document, Julia REPL, Bash shell, directory editor, pdf) is associated with a different major mode

File extensions, particular markers in the file, or other elements tell Emacs to automatically switch to the appropriate major mode

Only one major mode is active at a time

Switching to a different major mode is possible by running the corresponding major mode command (e.g. `M-x python-mode` will switch to Python mode)

### Fundamental mode

`fundamental-mode` is the most basic major mode, with no particular feature

This is the mode enabled by default if Emacs cannot detect what specific major mode to enable

### Minor modes

Minor modes provide additional and optional features that can be turned on or off (e.g. spell checking, auto-completion, auto-indentation, fancy undo behaviour, fancy parenthesis matching highlighting)

Minor modes can be turned on/off by running the corresponding minor mode commands (e.g. `M-x flyspell-mode` will turn spell checking on/off). The command `consult-minor-mode-menu` from the package [consult](https://github.com/minad/consult) makes this particularly easy

Each mode comes with a set of commands. [consult](https://github.com/minad/consult)'s command `consult-mode-command` makes it easy to search for commands within each mode

Any number of minor modes can be active at the same time

### List of enabled modes

By default, `<f1> m` or `M-x describe-mode` will open a list and description of the active modes

The major mode can also be determined with `<f1> v major-mode` (`<f1> v` runs the command `describe-variable`)

A list of minor modes can also be viewed with `<f1> v minor-mode-list`

Again, [consult](https://github.com/minad/consult)'s `consult-minor-mode-menu` makes all this much nicer

### The mode line

Another way to get information about enabled modes is the mode line

![](img/display10.jpg){width="70%" fig-alt="noshadow" fig-align="center"}

### Hooks

Minor modes can be automatically enabled when other modes (major or minor) are enabled thanks to [hooks](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hooks.html)

:::{.example}

For example, to enable the aggressive indent minor mode whenever the ESS R major mode is enabled, you can add to your init file:

:::

```{.lisp}
(add-hook 'ess-r-mode-hook 'aggressive-indent-mode)
```

:::{.example}

Or, using [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package), now part of base Emacs:

:::

```{.lisp}
(use-package aggressive-indent
:hook (ess-r-mode . aggressive-indent-mode))
```

### Modes source code

To see the source code of a mode, run `<f1> v` (or `M-x describe-variable`) followed by the name of the mode map

This will open a help buffer with a link to the source code file

:::{.example}

For example `<f1> v text-mode-map` will open a help buffer with a link to `text-mode.el`

:::

:::{.note}

The help buffer opened by `<f1> m` or `M-x describe-mode` also gives a link to the source code of the major mode

:::

Looking at the source code of a mode is very useful to customize it

### Customizing modes

In Emacs, **everything** is customizable

To customize modes, you can write Emacs Lisp code in your [init file](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html) (the configuration file that gets loaded when Emacs launches) or you can use the [easy customization interface](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html)

:::{.example}

For example, to customize the Markdown major mode, you would run `M-x customize-group markdown`

:::

### Evaluation order

If you write your own Emacs code, be careful that functions and variables take the value of their last loaded version. The order in which Emacs code is evaluated thus matters

You want to evaluate as little as possible when you launch Emacs to speed up start-up time (lazy evaluation): you don't want to load every single package that you have installed

This means that if you overwrite a function or variable of a mode in your init file, the init file is read at start-up, but when that mode is launched, the default function/variable will overwrite the custom one you wrote in your init file

To by-pass this problem, you can use `eval-after-load`

:::{.example}

Example:

```{.lisp}
(eval-after-load
 "markdown"
 '(defun markdown-demote ()
    ...))
```

:::

:::{.note}

[use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) has the `:init` and `:config` keyword symbols that ensure that the following expressions are evaluated respectively before or after the loading of a package

:::

### Customizing kbd

Most modes come with specific [keymaps](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Keymaps.html): sets of kbd only active when the mode is enabled. These kbd of course can be customized

:::{.example}

For example, to modify the kbd for the function `markdown-outline-previous` in the `markdown-mode-map`:

:::

```{.lisp}
(define-key markdown-mode-map (kbd "M-p") 'markdown-outline-previous)
```

:::{.example}

Or, using [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package):

:::

```{.lisp}
(use-package markdown-mode
	:bind (:map markdown-mode-map
				("M-p" . markdown-outline-previous)))
```

### Polymode

While it is normally impossible to associate multiple major modes with a single buffer, [Polymode](https://github.com/polymode) allows to insert sections of a major mode within another major mode

This is extremely convenient for instance to embed sections of code within human text, or even to have code executed within human text (e.g. [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) or its successor [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [Org Babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/))

`markdown-mode` with snippets of `julia-mode`:

````
Julia has "assignment by operation" operators:

```{{julia}}
a = 2;
a += 7    # this is the same as a = a + 7
```

There is a *left* division operator:

```{{julia}}
2\8 == 8/2
```
````
