title: Full Python IDE in Emacs
author: Marie-Hélène Burle

:::{.def}

There are quite a few packages that can turn Emacs into a Python IDE (a classic example is [elpy](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy) and since version 29, [eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot)—an LSP client—comes shipped with Emacs).

After playing with many of the options, I settled on a selection of packages that turn Emacs into a truly impressive Python IDE:

- [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/), [lsp-ui](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui), and [lsp-pyright](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-pyright) provide astounding code completion, debugging, code navigation, and many helpers,

- [py-vterm-interaction.el](https://github.com/vale981/py-vterm-interaction.el) runs your favourite Python shell (Python REPL, [ipython](https://github.com/ipython/ipython), [ptpython](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/ptpython), or ptipython) in a much improved Emacs terminal emulator,

- [emacs-reformatter](https://github.com/purcell/emacs-reformatter) reformats your code with the linter of your choice (e.g. [black](https://github.com/psf/black) or the much faster [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)).
