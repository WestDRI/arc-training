A good text editor is one of the most important tools a scientific programmer needs to choose and master.

Emacs is a free, open source, and incredibly powerful text editor that can be turned into a complete IDE for writing and running code, and so much more.

## A brief history of Emacs

[GNU Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Emacs) is the most popular version of the [Emacs text-editor family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs).

The first EMACS was written in 1976 by [Davd A. Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Moon) and [Guy L. Steele Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_L._Steele_Jr.) at [the MIT AI Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory). The development of GNU Emacs was started in 1984 by [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman)—a [free software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement) activist and father of the [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) concept. It is amongst the oldest [free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) still under development. Despite its age, development actually remains very active with modern and powerful optimizations implemented constantly.

GNU Emacs remains a symbol of [the hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) of the 70s and 80s, particularly in its rivalry with [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_(text_editor)) as part of the [editor war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war).

Its editing functionalities are written in [Emacs Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp)—a dialect of the [Lisp programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) (the rest and the interpreter are written in C).

The official GNU Emacs website can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

## Why use Emacs?

To brag. Obviously.

But there are other reasons:

- Free and open source
- Endlessly customizable
- Amazing diff
- Easy macros and automation
- [Text and file searching](wb_new_tools.qmd)
- Bookmarks
- [Great programming IDE](wb_ide.qmd)
- [Lossless and endless undo/redo](wb_ide.qmd)
- [Powerful integration with Git](https://github.com/magit/magit)
- Email, Slack, Telegram, calendar, IRC...
- File manager
- Unified set of shortcuts, search functionality, and environment for any tasks (easier than learning new IDEs and GUIs all the time!)
- Tetris! and [other games](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/fun-games-in-emacs)
- Calculator, calendar...
- [X windows manager](https://github.com/emacs-exwm/exwm)
- Fun!
- ...

Emacs can do just about anything (except the laundry).

Now ... getting started can be daunting ...

... and it doesn't necessarily get easier.

But it is worth it!
