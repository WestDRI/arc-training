A good text editor is one of the most important tools a scientific programmer needs to choose and master. Emacs is a free, open source, and incredibly powerful editor that can be turned into a complete IDE for writing and running code.

## What is Emacs?

[GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a free and open source text editor with endless power and customization.

Its editing functionalities are written in [Emacs Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp)—a dialect of the [Lisp programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))—while the rest of Emacs and its interpreter are written in C for performance.

## Why use Emacs?

To brag. Obviously.
