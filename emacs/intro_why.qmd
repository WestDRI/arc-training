## What is Emacs?

[GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a free and open source software.

The editing functionality of Emacs are written in [Emacs Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp)—a dialect of the [Lisp programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) (the rest of Emacs and its interpreter are written in C for performance).

Emacs is endlessly customizable to anyone with a basic knowledge of Emacs Lisp. In particular,  [variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Variables.html) and [functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Functions.html) setting the behaviour and appearance of the text editor can be created or modified.

The language is [well documented](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/).

## Why use Emacs?

![To brag. Obviously.](img/emacs2.jpg){fig-alt="noshadow" width="65%"}

But there are other reasons:

- Free and open source
- Endlessly customizable
- Amazing diff
- Macros
- [Text and file searching](wb_emacs_new_tools.qmd)
- [Great programming IDE](wb_emacs_ide.qmd)
- [Lossless and endless undo/redo](wb_emacs_ide.qmd)
- Email, Slack, Telegram, calendar
- Quick editing of file names and directories
- Unified set of shortcuts, search functionality, and environment for any tasks (easier than learning new IDEs and GUIs all the time!)
- Tetris!
- Fun!
- ...

But it's all worth it!
