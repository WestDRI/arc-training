Customizing Emacs is obviously a very complex topic. This section only aims at getting you started using the easy customization interface.

:::

## Customizing Emacs

In Emacs, **everything** is customizable.

There are two ways to customize Emacs (and you use both):

- you can write Emacs Lisp code in your [init file](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html) (the configuration file that gets loaded when Emacs launches),
- you can use the [easy customization interface](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html) which automatically adds code in your init file.

## The init file

It is standard to call the init file `.emacs` and create it in your home (`~/`). Of course, like everything else, this too can be customized ðŸ™‚

This file is read at startup and loads your Emacs configurations.

## Easy customization interface

The easy customization interface can be accessed by running one of the `customize` commands, the most important of which are:

- `customize-group` for groups of variables,
- `customize-variable` for individual variable,
- `customize-face` for the appearance of one type of text.

:::{.yourturn}

Your turn:

:::

Type `M-x customize-group python` to enter the Python group and have a look at the various variables in that group.

Try to change the default of the variable `python-indent-offset`. (You can select it from the group page, or you can access it directly with `M-x customize-variable python-indent-offset`).

Now, try to customize the `font-lock-keyword-face` face. You can run `M-x customize-face font-lock-keyword-face`, but an easier way is to place the cursor on an element of that face and run `M-x customize-face`. The name of the face your cursor was on will appear as the default, so you can then simply press Return.

:::

These will add customization at the top of your init file. If this file doesn't exist, it will automatically create it.

The customization will be in the form:

```{.lisp}
(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
(python-indent-offset 2))
(custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 (font-lock-keyword-face ((t (:foreground "green")))))
```
