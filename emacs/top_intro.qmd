Emacs is more than ever a *very* powerful text editor, with lots of recent exciting developments.

Getting started can be daunting however and you might be thinking: "If I have to take a course just to be able to edit a text, surely this thing is crazy".

This course intends to show you what makes Emacs such a fantastic tool and get you started in a smooth and gentle way. You will learn the basic concepts of Emacs, how to customize it, how to manage packages efficiently with the modern `use-package` approach, and basic concepts of Emacs Lisp.
