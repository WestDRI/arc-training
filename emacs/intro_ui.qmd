To understand the documentation, it is important to learn a little bit of Emacs terminology. Here, we will see what are Emacs windows, buffers, and other parts of the user interface.

:::

## Emacs frames

When Emacs is run in a GUI fashion, what the OS usually calls a window is actually called in Emacs terminology a *frame*. It is possible to launch several Emacs frames. Right now, because we are running Emacs directly in the terminal, we can only have one Emacs frame.

## Emacs windows

A frame can contain one or several *windows*.

## Buffers

The part of the window that contains the text to edit is called a *buffer*.

Buffers can hold the content of a file, a running process (e.g. REPL, shell), an image, a pdf...

## Echo area

At the bottom of each window is an *echo area*. This is where Emacs prints outputs.

## Minibuffer

The minibuffer is a small buffer that appears in the echo area with a prompt and a cursor whenever Emacs expects some input from you.

## Mode line

Between the buffer and the echo area is *the mode line*, an area that gives information on running modes, file name and path, place of the cursor in the buffer, whether the document has been modified, etc.
