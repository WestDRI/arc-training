:::{.def}



:::

A useful way to execute a command interactively, when it is not bound to a kbd, is to type `M-x` (this brings up the *minibuffer*, a place in which to type inputs) followed by the command name

:::{.example}

For example, `M-x count-words` will output the number of lines, sentences, words, and characters of the current buffer in the echo area
