[Polymode](https://github.com/polymode/polymode) enables Emacs to activate different major modes in different parts of a buffer. Among other usages, this is key to [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming): interweaving code blocks in, for instance, a markdown document, as you would do while creating [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) or [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) documents.

Polymode makes it easy to navigate between code blocks, select them, run them, etc. In this webinar, I will show this in action.
