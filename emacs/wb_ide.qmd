Once upon a time (not that long ago), powerful text editors such as [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) were the only nice interfaces to work with code. Nowadays, there are countless sleek and more GUI-oriented tools such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) that provide amazing IDEs, without the learning curve.

So why would one still use Emacs as a programming IDE?\
What does that even look like?

In this webinar, I will show some of the many reasons why I can't let go of Emacs, then show how it can be used as a programming IDE for Python, R, and Julia.
