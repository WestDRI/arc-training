:::{.def}

At the core of Emacs functioning are *modes*: *major modes* set the appearance and behaviour of Emacs for various types of texts (e.g. a Python script and a Markdown document will display different syntax highlighting and have different functions activated), while *minor modes* provide additional features that can be turned on or off (e.g. spell checking). Understanding how modes work is key to customizing Emacs and exploiting its strengths.

In this webinar, I will explain the functioning of Emacs modes and show how to manage and even customize them. Finally, I will demo how the package Polymode allows to embed sections of a type of text in another type (e.g. snippets of code in a Markdown document).
