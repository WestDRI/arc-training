Julia is fast: [just-in-time (JIT) compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) and [multiple dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch) bring efficiency to interactivity. People often say that using Julia feels like running R or python with a speed *almost* comparable to that of C.

But Julia also comes with parallel computing and multi-threading capabilities.

In this webinar, after a quickly presentation of some of the key features of Julia's beautifully concise syntax, I will dive into using Julia for HPC.
