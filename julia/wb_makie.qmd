:::{.def}

There are several popular data visualization libraries for the Julia programming language (e.g. [Plots](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl), [Gadfly](https://github.com/GiovineItalia/Gadfly.jl), [VegaLite](https://github.com/queryverse/VegaLite.jl), [Makie](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl)). They vary in their precompilation time, time to first plot, layout capabilities, ability to handle 3D data, ease of use, and syntax style. In this landscape, Makie focuses on high performance, fancy layouts, and extensibility.

Makie comes with multiple backends. In this webinar, we will cover:

- [GLMakie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/documentation/backends/glmakie/) (ideal for interactive 2D and 3D plotting)
- [WGLMakie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/documentation/backends/wglmakie/) (an equivalent that runs within browsers)
- [CairoMakie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/documentation/backends/cairomakie/) (best for high-quality vector graphics)

We will also see how to run Makie in the Alliance clusters.
