It can be convenient to plot directly in the REPL (for instance when using SSH).

```{julia}
using UnicodePlots
histogram(randn(1000), nbins=40)
```

Most of the time however, you will want to make nicer looking graphs. There are many options to plot in Julia.

:::{.example}

Example:

:::

```{julia}
# First run takes time as the package needs to compile
using StatsPlots
StatsPlots.histogram(randn(1000), bins=40)
```

:::{.note}

Here, we need to explicitly run `StatsPlots.histogram` rather than `histogram` to prevent a conflict with the function of the same name from the package UnicodePlots.
