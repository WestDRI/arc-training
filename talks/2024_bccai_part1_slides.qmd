## Why has big data become so essential? {.center}

All this data is key to the development of [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)

:::{.fragment}

so...

:::

:::{.fragment}

What is AI?

![](img/ai.png){width="60%"}

:::

## AI {.center}

Very loosely, you can think of neural networks (the most powerful form of AI) as an attempt to create a computer model that mimics the brain

## AI {.center}

In traditional computing, a programmer writes code that gives a computer detailed instructions of what to do

These instructions are called [a program]{.emph}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="40%"}

![](img/code.png)

<br><br><br><br>
Some action

:::

::::

## AI {.center}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

With neural networks, instead of writing a program, a programmer writes [a model]{.emph}, then feeds it lots of data and the model changes little by little over time

The model "learns" thanks to this data

:::

:::{.column width="3%"}
:::

:::{.column width="47%"}

[Simplilearn](https://www.youtube.com/@SimplilearnOfficial) has a video explaining how neural networks work in 5 min

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/bfmFfD2RIcg >}}

:::

::::

## AI {.center}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

This learning is nothing magical: some numbers in the model get tweaked a tiny bit, with each new piece of data, to make the model a little bit better

:::

:::{.column width="1%"}
:::

:::{.column width="47%"}

![From [xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com/)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/machine_learning.png)

:::

::::

## AI {.center}

Basically, we start with a model, train it with data, and we end up with a trained model that can be used as a traditional computer program

![](img/ai.webp){width="center"}

That trained model can be used to get predictions, generate art or speech, identify objects in images or spams in emails...

The only difference from traditional computing is that we don't write the program ourselves. Instead, we write a starting point (the untrained model), then train it with A LOT of data and let it get better by itself

## AI {.center}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

To get a very good model at the end—one that can write human language like ChatGPT or voice assistants for instance—you really need **A LOT OF DATA**

:::

:::{.column width="5%"}
:::

:::{.column width="45%"}

![](img/llm.jpg)

:::

## AI: an example {.center}

Imagine that you want a program able to detect tomatoes in pictures

This could be very useful to get real time data on your upcoming crop so that you can plan adequately (hiring staff, setting price, looking for markets)

For humans, this is straightforward

Yet, this is impossible to achieve with traditional programming because there are too many factors (location of the tomatoes in the image, quality of the picture, colour of the tomatoes...)

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="25%"}

![](img/tomato1.jpg)

:::

:::{.column width="25%"}

![](img/tomato2.jpg)

:::

:::{.column width="22.5%"}

![](img/tomato3.jpg)

:::

:::{.column width="27%"}

![](img/tomato4.jpg)

:::

::::

## AI: an example {.center}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="35%"}

However, by feeding a very large number of images with and without tomatoes **along with labels that give the number of tomatoes for each image** to a neural network, we can train it to recognize tomatoes in images that it has never seen

With each pair of image/label (e.g. "Picture 34, label: 56 tomatoes"), the model gets better

:::

:::{.column width="3%"}
:::

:::{.column width="62%"}

![](img/tomato.webp)

:::

::::

## AI: an example {.center}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

We don't write the program to do this. We write the starting model, then let it adjust by itself based on the data

It is a form of learning by experience, which is exactly what happens to us as we grow up. It is a form of programming that is much closer to how brains work than traditional programming

## Smart farming {.center}

Many AI tools are involved in improving all domains of agriculture, from irrigation management to supply chain and demand forecasting

The benefits are huge for both farmers (increased yields, reduced costs, better planning) and the environment (optimization of resources and pesticide use)
