## Why has big data become so essential? {.center}

All this data is key to the development of [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)

:::{.fragment}

so...

:::

What is AI?

![](img/ai.png){width="60%"}

:::

## AI {.center}

Very loosely, you can think of neural networks (the most powerful form of AI) as an attempt to create a computer model that mimics the brain

## AI {.center}

In traditional computing, a programmer writes code that gives a computer detailed instructions of what to do

These instructions are called [a program]{.emph}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="40%"}

![](img/code.png)

:::

:::{.column width="20%"}

<br><br><br>
Some action

:::

::::

## AI {.center}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

With neural networks, instead of writing a program, a programmer writes [a model]{.emph}, then feeds it lots of data and the model changes little by little over time

The model "learns" thanks to this data

:::

:::{.column width="1%"}
:::

:::{.column width="47%"}



:::

::::

## AI {.center}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

This learning is nothing magical: some numbers in the model get tweaked a tiny bit, with each new piece of data, to make the model a little bit better

:::

## AI {.center}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

To get a very good model at the end—one that can write human language like ChatGPT for instance—you need **A LOT OF DATA**

## AI: an example {.center}

You want a program able to detect tomatoes in an image

As human, this is straightforward

Yet, for a traditional approach, this is truly impossible because there are too many factors (location of the tomato in the image, quality of the picture, colour of the tomato...)

## AI: an example {.center}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

By feeding a very large number of images with and without tomatoes to a neural network we can now train that model to recognize tomatoes in images that it has never seen

## Why now? {.center}

Farmers can use powerful models to make informed decision in real time. This can be followed by the automation of some action (e.g. watering)

## Diagnosing and implementing big data solutions {.center}

Join us **tomorrow at 11am in the Mount Baker Room** for our 2<sup>nd</sup> session

We will have an interactive workshop to:

- Brainstorm on how big data can benefit your operation
- Help you make the transition to smart farming

<br>

:::{.note}

If you are unable to attend, you will find the slides [here](2024_bccai_part2_slides.qmd){target="_blank"} tomorrow, but it will be an interactive clinic with most of the material covered in the activity
