This presentation gives an overview of the course ***Coding fundamentals for humanists*** offered at [Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI)](https://dhsi.org/) every year.

The course covers core concepts of programming languages, an introduction to [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/), the basics of [Python](https://www.python.org/), [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) querying, and [web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping). The format is a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, guidance on how to use [large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llm) for coding, and projects relevant to the attendees' academic research.
