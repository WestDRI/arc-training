Over the past five years, an instructor from [ACENET](https://ace-net.ca/) and I have been teaching a week-long course called *"coding fundamentals for humanists"* at the [digital humanities summer institute (DHSI)](https://dhsi.org/). The course is an introduction to coding concepts using Python as an example to humanities professors, deans, graduate students, and librarians with no programming experience. The goal is to demystify xxx and remove any apprehension xxx as well as to provide concrete applications useful to the field of social sciences.

In 2025, I decided to teach my sections of the course using [large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model).

In this talk, I am presenting my motivations for doing so as well as my reflections after this experiment.
