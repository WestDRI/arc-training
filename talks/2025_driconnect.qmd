The Digital Research Alliance of Canada has two equally important audiences: stake holders and researchers.

Stake holders because without money nothing can be done. \
Researchers because without them what's the point?

The communication to stake holders is mature, well established and polished: a beautiful website, a good newsletter. The communication to the research community however could be improved: links to important resources such as the Alliance wiki and computing training events are lacking or buried and hard to find on both the website and the newsletter. The upcoming launch of a training discovery platform will help, but not fully solve, these gaps.

I suggest that members of the National Training Coordination Council, Alliance staff, and anybody interested in this topic gather to discuss this question in a respectful and open-minded way. If we work together, we should be able to improve the research-facing side of the Alliance and communicate our technical services more effectively to the research community.
