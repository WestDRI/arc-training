This two-part workshop illustrates how big data is used in the agriculture sector, clarifies concepts, and provides the basis to communicate in the field.

Session 1 demystifies big data and covers three case studies in the agrotech industry, while session 2 presents an overview of big data challenges and provides the tools necessary to communicate with consultants to find solutions.
