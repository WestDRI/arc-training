## Who we are

### Simon Fraser University

:::{.column width="45%"}

[SFU](https://www.sfu.ca/) hosts the [Cedar supercomputer](https://www.sfu.ca/research/supercomputer-cedar)—a cluster of 100,400 CPUs and 1,352 GPUs [soon to be replaced by an even larger computer cluster](https://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/stories/2024/06/sfu-awarded--80-million-to-upgrade-supercomputing-facility-.html)

### SFU's Big Data Hub

:::{.column width="50%"}

Since 2016, [Simon Fraser University's Big Data Hub](https://www.sfu.ca/big-data.html) has been offering workshops, events, and consulting services to researchers and industry partners helping them remain at the top of the fast evolving data landscape

## Goals for this workshop

### Session 1

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

:::{.note}

Yesterday

:::

A (hopefully) friendly lecture to:

- Demystify big data
- Demonstrate the critical importance of big data in agriculture and farming

:::{.note}

If you missed the session, you can find the slides [here](2024_bccai_part1_slides.qmd){target="_blank"}

### Session 1 recap

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

Big data is defined by the 3 "V":

- Volume (lots of data is generated)
- Variety (images, sounds, text...)
- Velocity (generated continuously)

:::

Big data has become crucial because it allows to train artificial intelligence models

![](img/ai.webp){fig-alt="noshadow"}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

Once trained, those models are extremely powerful and capable of performing tasks impossible for traditional computer programs

(e.g. creating art, generating human text, chat bots, excellent forecasting and optimization, computer vision, self-driving cars...)

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

Big data and AI are transforming all sectors, including agriculture because they allow:

- Real time monitoring
- Better decision making
- Optimizations
- Automation of tasks

:::

:::{.column width="3%"}
:::

:::{.column width="47%"}

![](img/ag_ai.png)

:::

::::


However there are challenges to the implementation of such transformative methods

- Infrastructure development
- Skill gaps among agricultural professionals

:::{.fragment}

We are here to help \
This is the goal of today's session

### Session 2

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

:::{.note}

Today

:::

An interactive workshop to:

- Brainstorm on how big data can benefit your operation
- Help you make the transition to smart farming

:::

:::{.column width="3%"}

### Data management

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

First, let's focus on your data

I will ask you to think about:

- The data you use for your operation
- How you are collecting it and storing it
- How you could automate this

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

![](img/data.jpg)

::::

### Analytics

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

Now, let's think about what this data is actually used for:

- What is purpose of this data?
- How do you analyse it?
- What could be the benefits of using AI to process your data?

### Challenges

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="30%"}

What are the challenges of such an implementation

- at the financial level
- at the practical level
- due to knowledge gaps

### Who to turn to?

:::{.fragment}

Connecting with other operators can be extremely powerful in this transformation

:::

:::{.fragment}

You may also need to talk with researchers

:::

:::{.fragment}

You will need to find a technology provider

:::

:::{.fragment}

Here my colleagues from the Big Data Hub and the BCCAI will jump in to orientate you

### Communication with experts

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="45%"}

You need basic concepts and vocabulary to communicate your needs to technology providers and researchers

- What concept do you feel that you are lacking and that we should cover?
- Vocabulary clarification
