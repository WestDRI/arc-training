## Who we are

### Simon Fraser University

::::{layout="[50, 50]" layout-valign="bottom"}

[SFU](https://www.sfu.ca/) hosts the [Cedar supercomputer](https://www.sfu.ca/research/supercomputer-cedar)—a cluster of 100,400 CPUs and 1,352 GPUs [soon to be replaced by an even larger computer cluster](https://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/stories/2024/06/sfu-awarded--80-million-to-upgrade-supercomputing-facility-.html).

![](img/cedar.jpg)

:::

<br>
[SFU](https://www.sfu.ca/) also works with the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca/en) to offer researchers large amounts of computing power to solve challenging data and technology problems, as well as training to optimize their solutions.

### SFU's Big Data Hub

::::{layout="[50, 50]"}

Since 2016, [Simon Fraser University's Big Data Hub](https://www.sfu.ca/big-data.html) has been offering workshops, events, and consulting services to researchers and industry partners helping them remain at the top of the fast evolving data landscape.

## What is big data?

![](img/bigdata_definition.jpg)

### The 3 "V": Volume

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

#### Before

Farmers were taking measurements (e.g. on soil moisture) manually creating low volumes of data.

:::

:::{.column width="3%"}
:::

:::{.column width="47%"}

![](img/hand.jpg)

:::

::::

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

#### Now

Internet of Things (IoT) (e.g. hundreds of soil moisture sensors) collects large volumes of data.

:::

:::

:::{.column width="47%"}

![](img/sensor.jpg)

:::

::::

### The 3 "V": Variety

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

#### Before

There was a limited set of data a producer could collect.

:::

:::{.column width="47%"}

![](img/inspect.jpg)

:::

::::

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

#### Now

There are so many different types of data (e.g. satellite images, market data gathered from internet browsing...).

### The 3 "V": Velocity

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

#### Before

A farmer could only gather so much data, even with a lot of employees.

Data is generated in real time and accumulates at high speed.

### Why is it important?

:::{layout="[50, 50]"}

:::{.col}

Why has big data become so essential?

All this data is key to the development of [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).

So ...

What is AI?

:::

![](img/ai.png){width="60%"}

:::

### AI

Very loosely, you can think of neural networks (the most powerful form of AI) as an attempt to create a computer model that mimics the brain:

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="47%"}

![Biological neurons](img/neuron.jpg)

:::

:::{.column width="3%"}
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

![Neural network](img/nn.png)

:::

::::

In traditional computing, a programmer writes code that gives a computer detailed instructions of what to do.

These instructions are called [a program]{.emph}.

:::{layout="[40, 15, 30]" layout-valign="center"}

![](img/code.png)

![](img/arrow.svg){width="80%"}

Some action

::::

<br>

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

With neural networks, instead of writing a program, a programmer writes [a model]{.emph}, then feeds it lots of data and the model changes little by little over time.

The model "learns" thanks to this data.

:::

:::{.column width="3%"}
:::

:::{.column width="47%"}

[Simplilearn](https://www.youtube.com/@SimplilearnOfficial) has a video explaining how neural networks work in 5 min:

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/bfmFfD2RIcg >}}

:::

::::

<br>

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

This learning is nothing magical: some numbers in the model get tweaked a tiny bit, with each new piece of data, to make the model a little bit better.

:::

:::{.column width="1%"}
:::

:::{.column width="47%"}

![From [xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com/)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/machine_learning.png)

:::

::::

Basically, we start with a model, train it with data, and we end up with a trained model that can be used as a traditional computer program.

![](img/ai.webp){width="center"}

That trained model can be used to get predictions, generate art or speech, identify objects in images or spams in emails...

The only difference from traditional computing is that we don't write the program ourselves. Instead, we write a starting point (the untrained model), then train it with A LOT of data and let it get better by itself.

<br>

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

To get a very good model at the end—one that can write human language like ChatGPT or voice assistants for instance—you really need **A LOT OF DATA**.

### AI: an example

Imagine that you want a program able to detect tomatoes in pictures.

This could be very useful to get real time data on your upcoming crop so that you can plan adequately (hiring staff, setting price, looking for markets).

For humans, this is straightforward.

Yet, this is impossible to achieve with traditional programming because there are too many factors (location of the tomatoes in the image, quality of the picture, colour of the tomatoes...).

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="25%"}

![](img/tomato1.jpg)

:::

:::{.column width="25%"}

![](img/tomato2.jpg)

:::

:::{.column width="22.5%"}

![](img/tomato3.jpg)

:::

:::{.column width="27%"}

![](img/tomato4.jpg)

:::

::::

<br>

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="35%"}

However, by feeding a very large number of images with and without tomatoes **along with labels that give the number of tomatoes for each image** to a neural network, we can train it to recognize tomatoes in images that it has never seen.

With each pair of image/label (e.g. "Picture 34, label: 56 tomatoes"), the model gets better.

:::

:::{.column width="3%"}
:::

:::{.column width="62%"}

![](img/tomato.webp)

:::

::::

<br>

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

We don't write the program to do this. We write the starting model, then let it adjust by itself based on the data.

It is a form of learning by experience, which is exactly what happens to us as we grow up. It is a form of programming that is much closer to how brains work than traditional programming.

### Why now?

The idea is not new, but it is only recently that we have had enough computing power, internet connectivity, and storage capacity to implement it.

## Big data and AI in agriculture

### Smart farming

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

We already talked about data collection thanks to the Internet of Things (e.g. moisture sensors).

:::

:::{.column width="3%"}
:::

:::{.column width="47%"}

![](img/iot.png){width="80%"}

:::

::::

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="35%"}

But this goes much further as AI algorithms can be used for "precision agriculture".

:::

:::{.column width="65%"}

![[Karunathilake, E. M. B. M., Le, A. T., Heo, S., Chung, Y. S., & Mansoor, S. (2023). The path to smart farming: Innovations and opportunities in precision agriculture. Agriculture, 13(8), 1593.](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/13/8/1593)](img/smartfarming.jpg){width="65%"}

:::

::::

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="37%"}

Many AI tools are involved in improving all domains of agriculture, from irrigation management to supply chain and demand forecasting.

The benefits are huge for both farmers (increased yields, reduced costs, better planning) and the environment (optimization of resources and pesticide use).

### Decision making

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

#### Before

Farmers had to make decisions as best they could based on their experience and their limited data.

:::{.column width="47%"}

![](img/decision.jpg)

:::

::::

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

#### Now

Farmers can use powerful models to make informed decision in real time. This can be followed by the automation of some action (e.g. watering).

### Markets and supply chains

This next section looks at a review of market analysis and supply chain optimization.

#### A review

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="45%"}

Systematic literature review of peer-reviewed articles and conference papers published between 2014 and 2024^[[Elufioye, O. A., Ike, C. U., Odeyemi, O., Usman, F. O., & Mhlongo, N. Z. (2024). Ai-Driven predictive analytics in agricultural supply chains: a review: assessing the benefits and challenges of ai in forecasting demand and optimizing supply in agriculture. Computer Science & IT Research Journal, 5(2), 473-497.](https://fepbl.com/index.php/csitrj/article/view/817)] showed large improvements of demand forecasting accuracy and supply chain optimization.

Real time data analysis helped with predictive maintenance, market volatility, resource constraints, and climate variability.
