[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (the successor to [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)) uses Jupyter (for Python and Julia) or knitr (for R) to execute code blocks and insert them into markdown documents that then get rendered by Pandoc into PDFs, websites, or other documents. This makes it a great tool to create training websites.

In this webinar, I will show how I use Quarto to create all of the training material that I develop for webinars, workshops, and courses.
