### Use of LLMs to teach Python

It allowed students:

- to be much more independent,
- not to get frustrated over small road-blocks,
- to go much further than in previous years,
- to keep learning on their own,
- to now be able to apply Python to their research

On our end, we learnt how to better use LLMs to teach
