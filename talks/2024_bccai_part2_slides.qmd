## SFU's Big Data Hub {.center}

Since 2016, [Simon Fraser University's Big Data Hub](https://www.sfu.ca/big-data.html) has been offering workshops, events, and consulting services to researchers and industry partners helping them remain at the top of the fast evolving data landscape

[Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) hosts the [Cedar supercomputer](https://www.sfu.ca/research/supercomputer-cedar)—a cluster of 100,400 CPUs and 1,352 GPUs [soon to be replaced by an even larger computer cluster](https://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/stories/2024/06/sfu-awarded--80-million-to-upgrade-supercomputing-facility-.html)—and works with the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca/en) to offer researchers large amounts of computing power to solve challenging data and technology problems, as well as training to optimize their solutions

## SFU BC Centre for Agritech Innovation {.center}

Since 2022, [SFU BCCAI](https://www.sfu.ca/agritech-innovation.html) has been helping small and medium enterprises in the farming industry to embrace technology driven solutions by offering:

- Investment, expertise, and support for agritech projects
- Training opportunities
- A network of industry experts, academic researchers, government partners, the Indigenous community, and non-profits

## Understanding big data in agriculture {.center}

Let's recap what we covered yesterday, in [our 1<sup>st</sup> session on big data in agriculture](2024_bccai_part1_slides.qmd){target="_blank"}:



## Goals for this workshop {.center}

- Help you identify challenges you will encounter when you turn towards the use of big data
- Provide directions so that you can find solutions to solve these difficulties

## Challenges of big data for farmers {.center}

Make a list of the issues you think that you might encounter in your very specific context

![](img/problems.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Challenges of big data for farmers {.center}

* **Big data is fairly new in the agritech industry:** Not as much experience as in other fields
* **Data Collection and Storage:** Capturing and storing large volumes of data can be challenging and expensive
* **Data Analysis:** Analyzing big data requires specialized skills and tools, which may not be readily available to farmers
* **Data Security:** Large and valuable datasets can be attractive targets for hackers, so data security is paramount
* **Lack of Infrastructure:** In some rural areas, farmers may not have access to reliable internet connectivity, which can hinder data transmission and processing
