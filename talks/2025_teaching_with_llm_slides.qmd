# Rationale

## One week is too little to teach Python to beginners {.center}



## Students get frustrated by failures {.center}



## LLMs seem like the perfect answer {.center}



# How I went about it



# Reflections on the experiment


# Conclusions

## Things to keep in track of {.center}

- the technology
- the regulations
- society

## Things to keep in track of {.center}

- the technology (feasible)
- the regulations (easy for now as it's a vacuum)
- society (where I got caught by surprise)
