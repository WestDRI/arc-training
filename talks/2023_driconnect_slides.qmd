### So many opportunities

Huge amounts of computing power readily available

### Open source on steroids

Explosion of tools, libraries, software, new programming languages \
Powerful ML algorithms \
Literate programming is finally mainstream

<br>
But...

- PIs often don't have experience with new tools and are unable to help their students\
- Departments are slow to add courses needed by students \
- Some fields don't have a strong computing culture

# Our training

<br><br>

A large team of 2 to develop the material, organize events, advertise, build magic castles, websites, and posters, handle registrations and emails, and teach[^1]

[^1]: Megan and James are very supportive

53 webinars/workshops/courses taught since the start of 2023
