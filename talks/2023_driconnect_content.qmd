## Times are changing

### So many opportunities

Huge amounts of computing power readily available

### Open source on steroids

Explosion of tools, libraries, software, new programming languages \
Powerful ML algorithms \
Literate programming is finally mainstream

But...

- PIs often don't have experience with new tools and are unable to help their students\
- Departments are slow to add courses needed by students \
- Some fields don't have a strong computing culture

## Our training

### Topics

- Unix shell
- HPC
- Version control with Git/DataLad
- Scientific programming in R/Python/Julia
- Parallel computing in R/Julia/Chapel
- Deep learning with PyTorch
- Scientific visualization
- Containers/Alliance clouds/VMs
- Webscraping in R/Python
- GIS in R
- Scientific publishing with Quarto

A large team of 2 to develop the material, organize events, advertise, build magic castles, websites, and posters, handle registrations and emails, and teach[^1]

[^1]: Megan and James are very supportive

53 webinars/workshops/courses taught since the start of 2023

## Now ... one little damper ...

Times are changing.

Fast.
