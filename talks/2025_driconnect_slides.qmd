## Alliance website {.center}

### 2 buttons on the front page leading to 2 sub-websites <br><br>

My arguments:

It would make the information researchers need easy to find

2 distinct audiences with different expectations vis-Ã -vis the Alliance &nbsp;âž¡ &nbsp;2 sub-websites

## Alliance website {.center}

### 2 buttons on the front page leading to 2 sub-websites <br><br>

- Do you find this idea worthwhile?

## Alliance newsletter {.center}

### 2 different newsletters for 2 different audiences <br><br>

My argument: same thing!

Stake holders want to see that the Alliance is great, productive, and involved in transformative computing

Researchers want practical information that can be useful to them

# Request

## Mailing list: the problem {.center}

Many of us are struggling to find ways to reach researchers to inform them of our training

[Explora](https://explora.alliancecan.ca/) is here and will help a lot! ðŸ¥³

But it won't solve everything:

- Users will need to be informed and reminded that Explora exists
- Some users might prefer to get emails about upcoming training events

## Mailing list: an asset that could help {.center}
